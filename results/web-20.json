Do you expect anyone to vote for Seinfeld on a Friend's page? I like both but I rewatch Friends more. Friends is more dear to me;can watch a lot over n over.

In the new book by journalist and author Amy Odell, Paltrow is described as \"one of the most resented celebrities in the world\". \"Women's ambition is not always viewed positively, and I wondered if that's why Gwyneth downplayed her ambition early in her career,\" says Odell. \"With Gwyneth, we see her ambition in the breadth of Goop – she wanted Goop to do everything, and to execute it all perfectly. One of the focal points of Odell's book is the close father-daughter relationship between Bruce and Gwyneth.

Lindemann notes in her recent book *True Story: What Reality TV Says About Us*: “for all of its extreme personalities and outlandish premises, reality TV reflects *how regressive we truly are*.” With that in mind, our list of reality TV’s most influential seasons is not a celebration of every show, or of the genre writ large. Pozner notes In her influential 2010 book *Reality Bites Back: The Troubling Truth About Guilty Pleasure TV*, reality programming “has the power to influence our notions of normalcy versus difference, convince us that certain behaviors are ‘innate’ for different groups of people, and present culturally constructed norms of gender, race, class, and sexuality as ‘natural,’” rather than as a reaction to external circumstances.

Her analysis found, among other things, that people who watch a lot of these reality competition shows are *significantly* more likely to believe in a rags-to-riches narrative — that economic mobility is available to any hard-working American. For people who were heavy viewers of these shows, who watched five or six of them, the impact on believing in the American dream was comparable to the effect of having immigrant parents — which is a huge impact. I think that’s where the news media effects get amplified — not because a lot of people are watching, but because it changes how we think about what others are up to, or what others are doing.",

I’m glad my list is helpful to you, good luck with the movies! As my daughter gets older (11 almost 12) I don’t keep up with the younger kids movies like I should. I went on this site to look at age approoriate movies because I know that some of the movies although they are Disney movies can be kind of scary or the contents are more for 7 8 or 9 yr olds.

This investigation sought to provide greater understanding of the predominant messages children receive about the general representation, structure, and function of families within Disney animated films from 1937 to 2018. However, nuclear family portrayals within Disney animated films were less often depicted in comparison to other forms of children’s media.

This exploratory study examines how Disney animated films over the last eight decades portraited the presence of parents in the life of the child characters. The research question is: How do Disney animated films portray the main child character’s parents in the stories? This study found that Disney animated films historically have not focused on the entire family unit, mainly by not having the main child character’s parents present in the story.",

Binge-watching as an observed cultural phenomenon has become popular with the rise of video streaming services in the 2006–2007 time frame, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Hulu through which the viewer can watch television shows and movies on-demand. In July 2013, Entertainment Weekly's website listed the top five television series suited for the new entertainment-consumption phenomenon of binge-watching, which has emerged as viewers have chosen to watch whole seasons of TV series, or even whole series, at a sitting. Within the television industry, speculation emerged in the early 2020s that binge watching a new series could make a series less memorable in the long term compared to shows released on a more traditional schedule; various streaming providers, led by Disney+, have had success releasing some of their original series on a weekly schedule, in contrast to the Netflix model which is most aggressive among the streaming providers in releasing episodes all at once.",

But while film studios raced to combat the last few years of instability in the entertainment industry, this data analysis shows that opportunities for people of color fell across the board after recent gains, while women also saw a drop as writers, even as their share of lead roles increased. Even as the domestic and global box offices responded positively to diverse films, Hollywood’s progress slid in terms of race, ethnicity and disability, while women posted gains in a few categories. Another look at investment found that like 2023, white women directors were more likely than white men or people of color to helm films with lower budgets; 45.5% of their films had budgets less than $20 million.",

In this work, we illustrate use of a new regulatory framework to enable computational research on film that permits circumvention of technological protection measures on digital video discs (DVDs). We design a computational pipeline for measuring the representation of gender and race/ethnicity in film, drawing on computer vision models for recognizing actors and human perceptions of gender and race/ethnicity. In many ways, this data-driven human work represents a gold standard for analysis, in carrying out careful observational research tying determinations of gender and race to constructs like “leading role.” At the same time, the past 10 y have also seen the rise of computational methods from computer vision reaching a level of maturity that permits their use on measurements of culture (20). We build directly on this work by bringing together two sources of information to measure representation on screen: computational methods to recognize the actors who appear in frames and human judgments about their race/ethnicity and gender.",

Studying literature develops practical, transferable skills valued across careers. ## Why Do We Study Literature? **Get more information about studying literature at Gustavus Adolphus**. Studying the literary traditions of different cultures around the world provides you with a deeper understanding of what a culture's literature says about its people's values and world views. ### Exploring the Connection Between Creative Writing and Studying Literature. Studying literature provides inspiration and examples for the creative writer. ## Why Our Students are Studying Literature. Students from all backgrounds find that their literature studies open their minds to unique perspectives and give them real-world skills — useful no matter what their major may be. In my case, having the opportunity to study literature in two different languages has helped me to find similarities in two different cultures, and to also find that although literature varies in form and content, it is important and it is a central part of many lives.\".",

Recent research in cognitive science, psychology and neuroscience has demonstrated that deep reading — slow, immersive, rich in sensory detail and emotional and moral complexity — is a distinctive experience, different in kind from the mere decoding of words. The study also found that young people who read daily only onscreen were nearly two times less likely to be above-average readers than those who read daily in print or both in print and onscreen.",

Based on the **Tony Award-winning stage musical**, *Matilda the Musical* premiered on Netflix in December 2022, bringing to the screen the songs of Tim Minchin like “Naughty,” “When I Grow Up,” and the TikTok favorite “Revolting Children.” Featuring a film debut from Alisha Weir, starring in the title role, *Roald Dahl’s Matilda the Musical* is sure to be a classic. This film adaptation is based on Lin-Manuel Miranda’s smash hit Broadway musical of the same name, which first went into performances in July of 2005, winning the Tony Award for Best Original Score. The musical is widely praised as one of the best Broadway productions of all time, earning multiple Broadway and West End revivals alongside this star-studded film adaptation.",

The structures and requirements at poetry slams have shaped a certain style of poetry which tends to be successful within the slam context; it is work in this style which is generally termed ‘slam poetry.’ For instance, the requirement that poems performed at slams must be under three minutes has led to the creation of a style which values poems of this length.",

Slam poetry fuses Negritude-inspired, politically charged themes of injustice and its emotional impact with the Beat Generation’s irreverence for rules and structure to create a completely new style of poetic performance art. Owing to slam poetry’s origins as a popular rather than a literary form, poets who work in the format strive to use simple, straightforward language to communicate emotionally impactful, relevant messages that resonate with everyday listeners. The rules of a poetry slam vary from one event to the next, but most involve successive rounds of competition in which participants perform one or more works that are evaluated by judges.",

Of course, this list is *not* about capturing all of spoken word and slam poetry culture in one piece of writing; part of the beauty of our community is that we don’t all agree on everything, and the work that we do is fluid, dynamic, and impacted by context, identities, and intertwining thought-currents. * **“Slam Poetry”** is often used interchangeably with “spoken word,” but I would argue that it means something more specific: slam poetry is spoken word performed at a poetry slam, which is a *specific* kind of performance/event (more on that later). Spoken Word is Poetry, Whether You Like It or Not**. Spoken Word is Bigger than Poetry Slams**. To support anyone who might be interested, I’ve tried to collect a few resources here, including a video series of tips, tools, and tactics for aspiring spoken word poets, a list of all of the open mics and poetry slams in my community, a list of favorite poems by other artists, and more.",

The Cultural Politics of Slam Poetry is the first critical book to take an in-depth look at slam, shedding light on the relationships that slam poets build with their audiences through race and identity performance and revealing how poets come to celebrate (and at times exploit) the politics of difference in American culture.",

But the problem is that once you start to build an audience based on outrage and anger, as MSNBC and CNN are both doing in the age of Trump, you risk tumbling down a slippery slope, which is exactly what happened to Fox News. It’s alarming because in many ways Fox and MSNBC have walked right into Trump’s trap when he says the press is “the enemy of the people.” They’ve built up their audiences based on anger or support for Trump, and now they’re attached to it.",

Standardized tests also provide a source of data for educators to reference when developing a plan of action for school improvement. While standardized testing plays a significant role in evaluating student performance and providing data for school improvement, it is not without its drawbacks. A balanced approach that incorporates multiple assessment methods alongside standardized tests can help create a more comprehensive and less stressful educational experience, ultimately benefiting both student development and overall school success. Schools use standardized testing to provide a uniform way of measuring students’ knowledge and skills. Standardized tests help schools organize their lessons, track their progress, make grading fairer, and show areas where students need extra help.",

This helps schools benchmark their students' educational outcomes against a broad sample used during the standardization process. 5. With a consistent measure of student achievement, standardized exams allow for meaningful district comparisons and help maintain educational standards nationwide. Standardized tests have been a staple in U.S. education since the mid-1800s, providing a consistent way to measure student achievement. Here’s what standardized testing can do:. By having all learners take the same standardized assessment — regardless of their school or district — school leaders can easily compare student test scores across diverse backgrounds. Standardized tests can highlight achievement gaps between student groups, like those from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Savvy students can often guess answers on standardized tests based on familiar patterns or questions they already know. Standardized tests can undermine the confidence of previously successful students. Nevertheless, these tests help educators pinpoint learning gaps by comparing student knowledge.",

Every analysis found the same trend: The higher a student’s middle-school test scores, the more likely they are to graduate high school, attend college, and earn a college degree. Fewer than 1 percent of students who score below basic in 8th-grade reading go on to earn a four-year college degree compared with almost 23 percent of students who score proficient and 43 percent of students with advanced scores.

Students have a voice in how they demonstrate their learning.”. MCIEA is a partnership between these school districts and their local teachers unions, who are working together to create a fair and effective accountability system, offering a more dynamic picture of student quality and learning than a single standardized test. “The first objective of MCIEA is to measure  student learning in a way that relies on teacher-created, classroom-embedded, performance assessments rather than externally created standardized assessments,” says MCIEA co-founder Jack  Schneider.",

Research has shown that high-stakes testing causes damage to individual students and education. ### High-stakes tests are unfair to many students. Many students do not have a fair opportunity to learn the material on the test because they attend poorly-funded schools with large class sizes, too many teachers without subject area certification, and inadequate books, libraries, laboratories, computers and other facilities. ### High-stakes testing drives out good teachers. ### Conclusion: High-stakes testing does not improve education. High-stakes testing punishes students, and often teachers, for things they cannot control. In a high-stakes testing environment, the limit to educational improvement is largely dictated by the tests – but the tests are a poor measure of high-quality curriculum and learning.

Short, low-stakes tests also help teachers gauge how well students understand the material and what they need to reteach. Teachers should tread carefully with test design, however, as not all tests help students retain information. In the end, well-constructed multiple choice tests, with clear questions and plausible answers (and no all- or none-of-the-above choices), can be a useful way to assess students’ understanding of material, particularly if the answers are quickly reviewed by the teacher.",

In a sense, we could say that this non-eventful time is linear; it moves along the line with posts marked as past, present, and future. You could interpret those events as a linear time moving from past to present and future points on the timeline. During almost all of its history, most of the humankind believed that time was cyclic. Therefore, the question “is time linear or cyclical?” could, basically, be turned into this question “Is humankind’s history linear or cyclical?”.",

Orwellian discourse: One kind of conflict occurs when politically correct norms lead to the kind of abuse of language that Orwell criticizes in “Politics of the English Language.” We noted earlier that the petty misapplication of language-norms isn’t worth making a fuss over, but as Orwell points out, the vague and imprecise use of terms like “fascism” can come to serve as a “defense of the indefensible.”(1946 p.162) Contemporary versions of this on the right are easily recognized, as when a kill list becomes a “disposition matrix,” but political correctness seems to involve a similar tendency.",

As a result, some people will complain that they don’t want to speak up because they fear being “criticized” or “stigmatized.” These people should recognize that their fear isn’t a sign of the environment’s political correctness or hostility toward free expression; it’s just a sign that they need more courage—for it requires courage to stay engaged with difference.",

America has the greatest opportunity culture in the world. I wanted a list of why America is the greatest country in the world. America is the greatest, it was ordained by God to be a light to other nations just like God raised up Israel to be a light to other nations when they obeyed God. Understand there are evil forces that wants our nation to fall into total corruption that will lead us to destruction, as it happened to other nations like Rome, and other nations, that served idle gods, not the true in living God through Jesus Christ.",

The rise of populist and nationalist policies, embodied by President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, are raising basic questions about the U.S. role in the world.

Finally, the students were asked to estimate how many suicide notes they had actually categorized correctly, and how many they thought an average student would get right. Even after the evidence “for their beliefs has been totally refuted, people fail to make appropriate revisions in those beliefs,” the researchers noted. Consider what’s become known as “confirmation bias,” the tendency people have to embrace information that supports their beliefs and reject information that contradicts them. The students were asked to respond to two studies. In a study conducted at Yale, graduate students were asked to rate their understanding of everyday devices, including toilets, zippers, and cylinder locks. This, they write, “may be the only form of thinking that will shatter the illusion of explanatory depth and change people’s attitudes.”.",

So far we’ve discussed the way that the violinist case can be used to defend the permissibility of abortion in the face of the argument from a right to life. The central innovation of this argument against the moral permissibility of abortion is that it proceeds without claiming that the fetus is a person, that the fetus has moral status, or that the fetus has a right to life. Like the argument from loss, this argument aspires to settle that abortion is morally wrong without addressing the thorny question of whether a fetus is a person, or has moral status. The argument aims to establish that *even if* fetuses have a right to life, then nevertheless abortion is permissible.",

In recognizing the right to abortion, *Roe* was consistent with earlier Supreme Court rulings recognizing a right of privacy that protects intimate and personal decisions—including those affecting child-rearing, marriage, procreation, and the use of contraception—from governmental interference. On January 22, 1973, the Supreme Court struck down Texas’s criminal ban on abortion and held that the right to abortion is a “fundamental right.”1In the 7–2 opinion, the Court held that, along with decisions relating to marriage, contraception, education, and family relationships, the decision about whether to continue or end a pregnancy is fundamental to “personal liberty.”2 In doing so, the Court recognized the great “detriment that the State would impose upon the pregnant woman by denying this choice,” including the health and economic risks of being forced to continue a pregnancy.3.",

Thomson maintains that whether a woman has a moral obligation to allow a fetus to remain in her body is a separate question from whether the fetus is a person with a right to life, and depends instead on the amount of sacrifice or burden it imposes on her. Instead of “repudiating a constitutional right we have not only previously recognized, but also expressly reaffirmed applying the doctrine of *stare decisis*“, the Court could simply have rejected viability as the point at which the state’s interest in protecting potential life outweighed the woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy, and upheld Mississippi’s right to ban abortions after 15 weeks.",

This overall increase in the number of abortions nationally can be largely attributed to the growth of telehealth for medication abortion, increased availability of lower cost medication abortion pills through virtual clinics, and in particular shield law abortions, where clinicians in legal states are mailing pills to individuals residing in states with bans and restrictions. Yet, in some states that have not banned abortion, telehealth may not be available because of state-level restrictions enacted prior to the *Dobbs* ruling that require patients to take the pills at a physical clinic, require ultrasounds for all abortions, or directly ban telehealth for abortion care. These telehealth abortions include those provided by brick-and-mortar clinics, virtual clinicians, and clinicians in states with shield laws who prescribe medication abortion to patients in states with bans or telehealth restrictions. Prior to the Dobbs ruling, several states had enacted private plan restrictions and banned abortion coverage from ACA Marketplace plans.",

Following changes that placed increased focus on inattention, rather than hyperactivity, there was a correspondingly significant increase in ADHD diagnosis among females.34 Specifically, between 1991 and 2008, diagnosis rates increased by a factor of 5.6 in girls compared to only 3.7 in boys.35 In other words, knowing girls and underrepresented groups are more likely to have missed diagnoses, and even present with different symptoms, patients and clinicians might be asking more questions as a result.

Adults with ADHD who are successfully treated with stimulant medications can stay longer in a job, sustain relationships better, and reduce anxiety caused by the difficulties organizing oneself at home, work, and other social settings.20 Despite the many benefits for the individual with ADHD and their community, many people do not receive treatment either because they are unaware of ADHD as the cause of their difficulties, or because of the stigma often attached to ADHD and stimulant use. Our clinic also offers patient education “skills groups” for people with ADHD to teach strategies for managing attention, memory, and executive functioning difficulties. Detailed history taking and observation of behavior during the clinic visit can help distinguish ADHD from other conditions that affect sustained attention and executive functioning including anxiety, depression, sleep difficulties, environmental changes, and other neurologic or psychiatric disorders.",

In our study, we build on this body of work by demonstrating how social media enactments of body positivity may not recognize or honor the Black fat and queer feminist origins of the movement, thereby privileging only normative body-related journeys through a white consumerist model of body positivity. In the context of fitness and movement motivation-type posts, the use of #BodyPositivity is used to reify status-quo, idealizations of white bodies, coopting the more inclusive Black body positivity movement. In some instances, it appeared that users somewhat haphazardly applied #BodyPositivity to their posts alongside, in some cases, dozens of other body/fitness related hashtags without acknowledging what the visual presence of whiteness and physical able-ness does in its occupation of space where the Black body positivity movement started.",

Maria Montessori began developing her educational philosophy and methods in 1897, attending courses in pedagogy at the University of Rome and learning educational theory.: 60 While visiting Rome's mental asylums during her schooling with a teacher, Montessori observed that confined children were in need of more stimulation from their environment. Montessori continued to extend her work during her lifetime, developing a comprehensive model of psychological development from birth to age 24, as well as educational approaches for children ages 0 to 3, 3 to 6, and 6 to 12. Montessori education involves free activity within a \"prepared environment\", meaning an educational environment tailored to basic human characteristics, to the specific characteristics of children at different ages, and to the individual personalities of each child. Montessori education for this level is less developed than programs for younger children. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Lillard, Angeline S (2013), \"Playful Learning and Montessori Education\" (PDF), *American Journal of Play*, vol.

In many parts of the world, renewable energy technologies (particularly wind and solar) are already more cost-effective than fossil fuels. Renewables further provide opportunities for inclusion through their potential for decentralised energy supply, enabling increased electricity access, economic opportunities and empowerment in remote areas far from the main power grid, which is the case for numerous Indigenous communities. ## **Where can renewable energy be used?**. Paris has developed various policies to promote the use of renewable energy. Medellin offers tax exemptions for companies that manufacture equipment for solar, wind and geothermal power to encourage more economic activity in the city’s renewable energy sector. To simplify the adoption of renewable energy in the city Bristol developed a comprehensive solar map for homes and businesses. In 2018, renewable energy supplied 100% of Burlington’s electricity. On 11 March, 2019 the City of Sydney approved the purchase of 100% renewable energy for the city after their large-site electricity contract expires on December 31, 2019.",

The result is that to fill the power gap, utilities employing solar and wind farms still need to keep their fossil-fueled generators running to provide power when the sun isn’t shining or the wind not blowing. In short, and as much as I wanted it to be otherwise, when it comes to replacing reliable, weather-independent, 24/7 coal or gas plants, the intermittency of solar and wind farms simply doesn’t fill the need. If we really want to mitigate climate change, it’s time to put to work technologies whose physics and math say they *actually* *can* supply the massive baseload power to replace those fossil plants and meet the new demand. If the United States is to meet the anticipated doubling of electricity demand *and* its climate goals, the American people must demand that their leaders include a significant buildout of new nuclear power.",

Items like personal cubicles or designated workstations that seemed like a better fit for the \"private office\" argument will start making an appearance in these spaces as a way to keep employees safe and productive. Closed spaces or private offices have been observed to enhance concentration and possibly productivity by minimizing the distractions (noise, movement) that may naturally occur in open-space environments. While there can be significant savings in the successful implementation of a well-designed open-space work environment, unless you're creating a space that's specifically designed to fit your company's business, mission, and culture, the savings could be for nothing.

If you’ve tried open offices, but they’re leading to low employee satisfaction or reduced productivity, then modular structures allow for a fast solution. Allied Modular specializes in these kinds of fixes, and provides businesses the ability to customize their office layouts the way they see fit.

Formula isn't digested as quickly as breast milk, so formula-fed babies don't need to eat as often, especially in the first few months. Your doctor may recommend that you both breastfeed and give your baby formula, or that you add powdered or liquid fortifiers to pumped breast milk. While your baby is getting supplemental feedings, it’s a good idea to pump your breast milk so you can start nursing as soon as baby is ready.

If you regularly spend time away from the baby, use a breast pump during your absence at the same frequency the baby would feed to maintain your milk supply. Breastfeeding has multiple benefits for you and your baby. Supplementing with formula will cause your baby to nurse less and further reduce your milk supply. After breastfeeding is established, you can allow family members to bottle-feed the baby expressed milk. If breastfeeding is not the best choice for you and your baby, iron-fortified commercially available formula is the next best option. Formula feeding is convenient and offers greater flexibility than breastfeeding.

Commercially prepared infant formulas are a nutritious alternative to breast milk, and even contain some vitamins and nutrients that breastfed babies need to get from supplements. **Time and frequency of feedings.** Because formula is less digestible than breast milk, formula-fed babies usually need to eat less often than breastfed babies. So formula can't provide a baby with the added protection against infection and illness that breast milk does. **Planning and organization.** Unlike breast milk — which is always available, unlimited, and served at the right temperature — formula feeding your baby requires planning and organization to make sure that you have what you need when you need it.",

The answer is that although immune cells, like those that make antibodies, are typically generated where the vaccine is given, they travel throughout the body, offering protection at the many sites where infection might occur.",

Once vaccines are introduced and used in countries, national health authorities continuously monitor vaccine safety to detect and immediately respond to potential concerns. WHO assists countries in strengthening vaccine safety monitoring and response systems. In prequalification, WHO independently assesses evidence on the quality, safety, and efficacy of vaccines and other medical products, helping ensure that only those that meet stringent international standards are used in public health programmes. WHO works closely with vaccine manufacturers, health authorities, national advisory committees and other partners to monitor, quickly detect and review any possible safety concerns. Globally, WHO supports countries through the Uppsala Monitoring Centre, a WHO collaborating centre in Sweden, which collects reports of vaccine safety events worldwide; and the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS),  an independent group of experts that reviews vaccine safety data and advises WHO.",

Nontherapeutic infant or child male circumcision (NTC)—the removal of a child’s foreskin in the absence of a valid medical indication—is an unnecessary surgery that causes pain, permanently alters the penis, and needlessly exposes a healthy child to risk of iatrogenic injury [13].",

This is what’s called the “pre-party.” The theory is that the plant knows you’re coming and starts working in your system in advance, like some mystical tentacles reaching out to welcome you to your new life. It has also left me feeling the need to return to plant medicine to gain deeper clarity and healing so that I can complete my purpose in this lifetime…but I’m so grateful I went and tell anyone who asks, it was worth the trip.”.",

Dr. Streem says people who use Ayahuasca for non-spiritual purposes usually do so because they want to experience side effects they perceive as positive, like euphoria. Interestingly, the *why* of Ayahuasca use seemed to play a role in the kind and severity of mental health side effects: People whose cultural or spiritual practices involved Ayahuasca use had notably fewer negative experiences than people who used it in an uncontrolled or recreational context. That risk is higher for people using Ayahuasca in concert with other substances and for individuals experiencing depression, anxiety, psychosis, mania and related mental health symptoms. If you’re familiar with Ayahuasca, you may have heard that researchers think it has the potential to help with a wide range of mental health conditions, like substance-use disorder (SUD), substance withdrawal, eating disorders, treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).",

Several older studies have focused on the effects of Ayahuasca on substance use disorders. While taking part in an Ayahuasca ceremony may seem alluring, consuming this psychedelic brew can lead to serious, even life threatening, side effects.

This retreat drew people from around the world who had come to drink ayahuasca with a family of Shipibo healers led by Maestra Rosa Pinedo Vasquez – affectionately known to guests as Mama Rosa.

A 1995 study of Michigan oncologists revealed five factors that were important to physicians when considering the approval or disapproval of PAS: global attitudes toward PAS (including ideas like “Does a patient have a right to end his or her life if he or she has an incurable disease,” and “Oncologists should have the right to help a patient commit suicide by medical means”), attitudes toward the acceptability of withholding/withdrawing life-sustaining therapies, philosophical prohibitions toward PAS, concerns of legal consequences of PAS, and beliefs that PAS could be avoided with better end-of-life care [12]. When asked about current practices of PAS in states where it is legal, only 24% of physicians disagreed (49% agree; 26% neutral) that the most common reason for patients seeking PAS is physical pain (Table 4).",

The judge who ruled that the Oregon physician-assisted suicide law was unconstitutional commented, \"The very lives of terminally ill persons depend on their own rational assessment of the value of their existence, and yet there is no requirement that they be evaluated by a mental health specialist.\"39 The physician should ask for a psychiatric consultation in every case where he or she is unsure whether the patient's request for death arises from a depression.

That a state can legalize physician-assisted suicide, as Oregon has done, highlights the difference between what is legal and what is ethical; what the state *allows* residents to do and what members of a given profession, in this case medicine, believe they *ought to* do. These activities in themselves, of course, do not violate the AMA *Code of Medical Ethics* that prohibits physician assistance with suicide: they are professional services rendered to all patients.",

Schooling is so integrated into family life that a group of researchers noted that “...homework tended to recreate the problems of school, such as status degradation.” An online survey of over 2,000 students and families found that 90% of students reported additional stress from homework, and 40% of families saw it as nothing more than busy work.",

Homework is a powerful tool to help narrow these inequities, giving children from all backgrounds the opportunity to keep learning when they are not in school. At this point, some teachers may be saying, “I can’t get my kids to hand in a worksheet, let alone rely on them to learn on their own.” And of course, effective use of homework in class relies on creating a strong system of accountability for getting kids to do it. This should include a schoolwide grading policy—at Success schools, missing and incomplete homework assignments receive a zero; students can get partial credit for work handed in late; and middle and high schoolers can revise their homework for a better grade—as well as consistently and explicitly noticing when kids are or are not prepared and offering praise and consequences.",

With the exception of the District of Columbia's special sales tax rate (8 percent, instead of its 6 percent general sales tax rate), all current soda taxes are based on a drink's volume. As such, the District of Columbia and Philadelphia are the only jurisdictions that tax diet sodas. #### What are other options for taxing soda?

The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God.”",

We can learn a lot from scientists about getting comfortable with being wrong, says physicist Professor Brian Cox.\n\nIn this chat with Fearne, Brian explains the difference between ‘having an argument’ and ‘making an argument’. The latter gives us confidence to ask curious questions, come to our own conclusions, and remain open to being wrong, without letting ego get in the way of connection or progress.\n\nBrian shares why being wrong is essential to learning and happiness, why ego blocks human progress, and how democracy itself depends on doubt. They dive into the beauty of curiosity, the randomness of life, why protecting our planet is the greatest moral responsibility we have and what the universe says about the meaning of being human, including finding personal motivation and purpose, and whether there’s life after death.\n\nFearne and Brian also wonder how we can make sure young girls aren’t discouraged from pursuing science, and Brian tells the story of being on the set of a famous alien movie...\n\nTickets for Brian’s 2026 world tour – Emergence – are available now.\n\nABOUT HAPPY PLACE\n\nFearne's HAPPY PLACE is a place to celebrate honesty, authenticity and community.

How long it takes for your body to die depends on your health, treatments you’re receiving and the cause of death. When you’re dying, you don’t sleep to recharge your mind and body. When you’re dying, your body temperature drops, and your skin may feel cold or clammy to the touch.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a first-line, empirically supported intervention for anxiety disorders. The article describes common and unique components of CBT interventions for the treatment of patients with anxiety and related disorders (i.e., panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, prolonged grief). One of the most well-researched and efficacious treatments for anxiety disorders is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Some combination of cognitive restructuring and behavioral experiments are often implemented in CBT across all anxiety disorders. CBT can be used as a stand-alone treatment, may be combined with standard medications for the treatment of patients with anxiety disorders (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), or used with novel interventions (e.g., mindfulness).

These and Hubbard’s other Scientology writings, both published and unpublished, are considered scriptures by the church. What pushed Hubbard from Dianetics to Scientology was his understanding, among other things, of the experience of “exteriorization,” the separation of individual consciousness from the body. The church asserts that, through Scientology training, its members come to understand both themselves as spiritual beings and engrams as energy clusters that inhibit the thetan from functioning freely. He has held the imperishable hope that someday in some way he would be free.” Consequently, the most sacred teachings of Scientology (the operating thetan, or OT, levels) are concerned with assisting the individual to operate as a fully conscious and functioning thetan.",

If these people are right, cases in which torture might be morally justified by the same types of consideration that can justify killing in self-defense will be very rare. If, after taking into account the effect that engaging in torture might have on general respect for the law that for-bids it, a person still has good reason to believe that morality requires that he engage in torture, because the person to be tortured is clearly liable and the torture would be a necessary and proportionate means of defending the innocent, then I think that person ought morally to engage in torture.",

The current study addresses these limitations through a person-centered approach: trajectories of birth family contact incorporating three features of contact (frequency of contact, satisfaction with contact, and participation in cross-network contact) across four time points (middle childhood, adolescence, emerging adulthood, and young adulthood) were used in examining the relation between contact and outcomes in a sample of young adults who were domestically adopted in infancy.

In a 5-country study on sex trafficking, most of the trafficked and prostituted women interviewed in the Philippines, Venezuela and the United States (3) strongly stated their opinion that prostitution should not be legalized and considered legitimate work, warning that legalization would create more risks and harm for women from already violent customer and pimps (Raymond et al, 2002).",

The overwhelming majority of sex workers are unable or unwilling to work under the conditions created by legalization, including applying for licenses, registering with local sheriffs, and working in one of the few brothels in rural Nevada, where workers are subject to their manager’s, county, and state rules. Even under the “legalization” model, Nevada has the highest prostitution arrest rate per capita, at 95.3 arrests per 100,000 residents.**2** This model may work for those who are able to participate, but it is not beneficial for all people engaged in the sex industry, nor does it carry broader public safety benefits that reach beyond the rural communities with brothels. Sex workers in New Zealand and in parts of Australia where sex work has been decriminalized report safe working conditions and frequently cooperate with law enforcement.",

Seen through the data and supporting cases regarding sex work and sexual assault, legalizing prostitution would have a positive effect on lowering violent crime rates in society, thus making communities safer as a whole.

Not only does sex work become safer when it is regulated, but legalization also works to weed out the black market that exists for prostitution, thereby making women safer overall. The underlying reason that people are uncomfortable listening to sex workers about legalizing prostitution has nothing to do with concern for the health and safety of women. The underlying reason people disagree with legalizing prostitution is that prostitution is viewed as amoral because it involves (mostly) women selling their bodies for financial gain. What is disingenuous is opposing legalized sex work for reasons that purport to be women’s safety, but that are actually coming from a place of discomfort over women openly engaging in sexual interactions for financial gain.",

By contrast, numerous studies have shown that decriminalizing prostitution would bring the industry into the realm of law, redirect attention from prosecuting commercial sex to prosecuting the crimes that are the actual causes of the harm, which could prevent sex trafficking, violence, and other kinds of danger. Since the selling or buying of sex services is an action between two individuals with mutual consent, taking place in a private space and having no foreseeable impact on other parties, the state should not have the right to prohibit the action under criminal law, independent of morality. If prostitution is decriminalized and becomes taxable income, the extra government revenue could be used to provide health care benefits for sex workers to ensure their mental and physical health, fund programs to eliminate human trafficking, and set up departments for regulating and standardizing the industry.",

Specifically regarding the Second Amendment, the Court wrote that the right to bear arms for a lawful purpose \"is not a right granted by the Constitution . The Court again noted that the Second Amendment only prohibits the federal government from infringing citizens’ gun rights. The Court held that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to keep and bear arms, wholly separate from serving in a militia. Concerning the \"militia\" clause, the Court held that it stated *why* the Framers included the Second Amendment but did not limit the right to keep and bear arms. Applying this approach to the case, the Court held that the Second Amendment plainly encompassed the petitioners’ rights to \"’bear’ arms in public for self-defense.\" The Court reviewed the respondents’ evidence regarding historical traditions of firearm regulation and determined they did not meet their burden.",

Joined with the support of the Courts for the Second Amendment right to bear arms has been the role of the powerful National Rifle Association (NRA), which championed gun rights and refused to make any compromises regarding restrictions on gun ownership. While gun rights and protection by the courts of the Second Amendment are currently solidly in place, that does not mean that reform of existing laws or a rejection of the arguments presented in the Heller and subsequent Supreme Court decisions are impossible to achieve.",

Scholars call this theory \"the collective rights theory.\" A collective rights theory of the Second Amendment asserts that citizens do not have an individual right to possess guns and that local, state, and federal legislative bodies therefore possess the authority to regulate firearms without implicating a constitutional right. The Court meticulously detailed the history and tradition of the Second Amendment at the time of the Constitutional Convention and proclaimed that the Second Amendment established an individual right for U.S. citizens to possess firearms. Similarly, the Court in dicta stated that firearm regulations would not implicate the Second Amendment if that weaponry cannot be used for law-abiding purposes. *Kachalsky v County of Westchester*, 701 F.3d 81 (2nd Cir. 2012) (holding that a New York law preventing individuals from obtaining a license to possess a concealed firearm in public for general purposes unless the individual showed proper cause did not violate the Second Amendment).",

According to the National Rifle Association, the number of fatal accidents involving firearms was at an all-time low in 1992, the most recent year for which statistical data are published.'79 These findings refute the concern that easy access to firearms could increase the number of accidental fatalities because the populace is usually perceived as inexperienced in handling firearms.3 0 The Lott and Mustard study shows that an increase in accidental deaths due to the passage of concealed firearm laws is statistically insignificant and is vastly outnumbered by other causes of death, even taking into account the negative effects of anti-gun propaganda by gun-control groups, which contributes to popular ignorance and results in more frequent misuse of firearms than would be the case otherwise.' Another important conclusion of several authors is that, in the states liberally issuing concealed firearm permits, property crimes increase substantially and concurrently with the decrease in serious crimes such as murder, rape and aggravated assault, which apparently reflects the reluctance of criminals to encounter armed individuals.'

On March 14, 2023, President Joe Biden issued an executive order: “Executive Order on Reducing Gun Violence and Making Our Communities Safer.” Among other actions, the order directed U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland “to ensure that licensed gun dealers are aware and conduct the required background checks before purchases” in compliance with the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (signed into law in June 2022).",

In July, 2022, California Governor Newsom signed into law AB 1594, which “requires manufacturers, distributors and dealers of guns and ammunition to abide by new state standards for the safety, marketing and sale of their products” and “empowers the state, local governments and individuals harmed by gun violence to sue companies that violate those standards.” By imposing tort liability on the gun industry, the bill may force gun manufacturers and dealers to conduct business in a more responsible manner.",

A single-celled organism called *Chromosphaera perkinsii* appears to possess a embryonic process similar to animal mitosis, even though the organism separated from animal’s evolutionary line a billion years ago. * While this similar process suggests that animals inherited their own version of the ability from their single-celled ancestors, scientists can’t rule out the possibility that this could be another case of convergent evolution. However, scientists from Switzerland and the U.S. have discovered that this animal contained genetic instructions from embryonic development, meaning that the eggs existed even before life itself. “This paper gets at the core question of developmental biology, which is how we go from one cell to a whole animal, by looking at a related process in a weird, microbial relative to animals,” John Burns, a senior research scientist at Bigelow Laboratory in Maine said in a press statement.",

Meta-analyses of published and unpublished trials have found that antidepressants have a placebo-subtracted effect size (standardized mean difference or SMD) in the treatment of anxiety disorders of around 0.3, which equates to a small improvement and is roughly the same magnitude of benefit as their effectiveness in the treatment of depression. Some antidepressants are used as a treatment for social anxiety disorder, but their efficacy is not entirely convincing, as only a small proportion of antidepressants showed some effectiveness for this condition. A 2019 meta-analysis found placebo improvement effect sizes (SMD) of about 1.2 for depression, 1.0 for anxiety disorders, and 0.6 for OCD with antidepressants.",

People who stop taking antidepressants too soon risk having the symptoms of their depression or anxiety problem return. Antidepressants do not have these effects.

Homework teaches students various beneficial skills that they will carry with them throughout their academic and professional life, from time management and organization to self-motivation and autonomous learning. Homework helps students of all ages build critical study abilities that help them throughout their academic careers. Homework is most effective when it allows students to revise what they learn in class. Homework also helps students develop key skills that they’ll use throughout their lives:. The skills learned in homework can then be applied to other subjects and practical situations in students’ daily lives. Homework helps parents track what their children are learning in school. According to a study, homework in primary schools has a minimal effect since students pursue unrelated assignments instead of solidifying what they have already learned.

Research published in the *High School Journal* indicated that students who spent between 31 and 90 minutes each day on homework “scored about 40 points higher on the SAT-Mathematics subtest than their peers, who reported spending no time on homework each day, on average.”.",

The researchers used survey data to examine perceptions about homework, student well-being and behavioral engagement in a sample of 4,317 students from 10 high-performing high schools in upper-middle-class California communities. **\\* Less time for friends, family and extracurricular pursuits:** Both the survey data and student responses indicate that spending too much time on homework meant that students were “not meeting their developmental needs or cultivating other critical life skills,” according to the researchers.

Robert Pressman, PhD, and colleagues recently investigated the 10-minute rule among more than 1,100 students, and found that elementary-school kids were receiving up to three times as much homework as recommended. On the positive side, students who spent more time on homework in that study did report being more behaviorally engaged in school — for instance, giving more effort and paying more attention in class, Galloway says. \"Teachers feel pressured to give homework because parents expect it to come home,\" says Galloway. Galloway argues teachers and school administrators need to set clear goals when it comes to homework — and parents and students should be in on the discussion, too.",

Building on the work of Ruhm, Tanaka [6] published a study in 2005 that aimed to estimate the health effects of parental leave while also including the United States in the dataset, incorporating data more recent than 1994, and including more robust controls for other health measures (such as low birthweight) and separate social policies [6]. Tanaka also notes the logic of the non-linear results (that additional leave seems to accrue benefits to later child health) but points out that there is a statistically significant reduction for all infant mortality categories [6], and acknowledges that it is possible that the more leave that is available to expectant mothers, the more likely they are to use some of it before birth.",

Reasons may include the focus on phasing-in NAMs over phasing-out animal use and the focus on transition within the regulatory sphere, although most animals are used in basic research. This paper employs the insights of French sociologist, Pierre Bourdieu, to explore the persistence of animal research within academia. Several of Bourdieu’s concepts are applied, including field and habitus, but perhaps it is his concept of capital that is most valuable in this context, providing a valuable shorthand for discussing the system of rewards and penalties within academia, clarifying how animal research converts into symbolic as well as social and economic capital and elucidating what scientists risk if they attempt to transition from animal research to NAMs. Bourdieu reminds us to attend to power relationships, particularly the relationship between the animal research field and the field of power.",

The major work advancing the ethical use of animals in research focuses not on a particular animal’s identity but rather broadly applicable guidelines for minimizing pain and increasing overall quality of life. It instructs researchers to replace the use of animals when possible, reduce the number of animals to minimum needed for valid results, and refine the experiment to limit suffering as much as possible[7]. “Ethical Guidelines, animal profile, various animal models used in periodontal research with alternatives and future perspectives.”  Journal of Indian Society of Periodontology 20(4), 360-368.

However, due to the expense of these instruments and the time required for body fat assessments, obesity is clinically defined by measures that ‘estimate’ adiposity from body weight, body build and height. The body mass index (BMI) is another measure used to define overweight and obesity and is considered a more accurate estimate of body fatness than IBW. Weight gain causes a number of hormonal, metabolic and molecular changes in the body that increase the risk for even greater fat accumulation. Such obesity-associated biological changes reduce the body’s ability to oxidize (burn) fat for energy, increase the conversion of glucose (carbohydrate) to fat, and increase the body’s capacity to store fat in fat storage depots (adipose tissue). Weight gain, therefore, changes the biology of the body in a manner that favors further weight gain and obesity.",

Since Disney films play an essential role in children’s learning process, critics voiced concerns that parents are often not portrayed in child-oriented movies. The analysis of the entire genre of Disney animated movies will help select suitable films for use in counseling to address how parents provide support and protection for the family and solve problems in times of despair.

The research question is: How do Disney animated films portray the main child character’s parents in the stories? This study found that Disney animated films historically have not focused on the entire family unit, mainly by not having the main child character’s parents present in the story.",

So where is the planet that might possibly host life, what evidence have scientists found, and is there reason for scepticism?

NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (formerly known as the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope, and scheduled to launch no later than May 2027), could zero in on a distant planet’s reflected light to detect the signatures of oxygen, water vapor, or some other powerful indication of possible life. To learn more about the advanced, space-based telescope technology — already in use, and being developed at NASA — to search for life among the stars, read about our planet hunters.

Dr Subir Sarkar, a lecturer in astrophysics at Cardiff University and part of the research team, said the research suggests K2-18b could have an ocean which could be potentially full of life - though he cautioned scientists \"don't know for sure\". He added that the research team's work will continue to focus on looking for life on other planets: \"Keep watching this space.\". But even if the Cambridge team obtains a five sigma result, that won't be conclusive proof that life exists on the planet, according to Prof Catherine Heymans of Edinburgh University and Scotland's Astronomer Royal, who is independent of the research team. The reason many researchers infer that the planet has a vast liquid ocean is the absence of the gas ammonia in K2-18b's atmosphere.",

This recognition of the role played by care for others is also present in many religious traditions – particularly in the ways that they address life’s sufferings. In both cases, care binds a good society together, in ways that sustain social hope.

Here, I place human sibling proportions in mammalian perspective by comparing data from a global sample of 103 human populations (*n* = 197 658 sibling dyads in total) and compare this with a dataset of 34 non-human mammal species (*n* = 61 163 sibling dyads). Although the variation in sibling composition across the human dataset is demonstrative of the obvious fact that humans are not universally monogamous, the finding that human rates of full siblings overlap with the range seen in socially monogamous mammal species and are consistently higher than those observed in non-monogamously mating mammal species lends weight to the broad-stroke characterization of monogamy as the modal mating pattern for our species.",

On the contrary, there is abundant evidence that war is a comparatively recent cultural addition to the human repertoire, acquired within the last 10,000 years or so as a result of several factors, including the invention of agriculture – resulting in the accumulation of valuable material resources that lend themselves to being stolen as well as defended, along with enabling the construction of elaborate social hierarchies – plus increasingly effective technologies for communication, coordination and killing.

Since Hollywood gets it wrong, and it’s actually very difficult to kill another human being, the general public is relatively unaware of reflex training — the training responsible for 90% of American soldiers firing at Vietnamese soldiers. There is no point to dehumanize, create distance, and tell others to see people as monsters if human beings are, in fact, naturally violent. But as Temple University psychologist Jeffrey Goldstein said, “when we don’t have wars, we call it the ‘interwar years.’ It’s a matter of selective reporting.” Or Kohn, yet again: “It is difficult to reconcile a theory of innate human aggressiveness with the simple fact that most people around us seem quite peaceful.”. The point of all this is that the nature of war requires conditioning people to fight for people they are trained to see as family.",

In Western dual-educated, male-female marriages, women who divorce face greater burdens because of decreased income and primary or sole responsibility for caring for children than men who divorce. Why, then, do these women initiate divorce more and fare better psychologically after a divorce than men? Here, we articulate an evolutionary mismatch perspective, informed by key findings in relationship science. We argue that mismatches between women's evolved preferences and configurations of modern marriage often clash, producing dissatisfaction. Women's unprecedented career ascendance also affords women ever more freedom to leave. We discuss pressures from social expectations for men and women that contribute to or compound these vulnerabilities. We conclude with key questions for future research, which can contribute to strategies for mitigating relationship dissatisfaction and the profound loss and pain that results from divorce.",

Looking beyond the direct effects of divorce on adults and children, it is also important to note the ways in which widespread divorce has eroded the institution of marriage — particularly, its assault on the quality, prevalence, and stability of marriage in American life. Just under a quarter of college-educated couples who married in the early 1970s divorced in their first ten years of marriage, compared to 34% of their less-educated peers. States should combine a one-year waiting period for married parents seeking a divorce with programs that educate those parents about the likely social and emotional consequences of their actions for their children.",

To protect your children from a lengthy and costly legal battle that will only serve to cause them to suffer, you and your spouse can have an Evolved, mediated collaborative divorce process.

And, of course, make sure to communicate the benefit of crowdsourcing to your team — it should be a welcome help, not a threat, to their work. In order to ensure your data and work are safe, make sure the crowdsourcing partner you choose doesn't provide their members with access to real data sets.

By promoting higher diversity in learning environments, affirmative action not only enhances the educational experience, but also promotes critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills.

        "content": "# Affirmative Action Policies to Increase Diversity Are Successful, but Controversial, Around the World. Affirmative action is a relatively recent tool for most countries, with policies gaining momentum from the 1990s onwards, particularly in politics. Affirmative action policies can include “soft” measures designed to increase minority representation in a candidate pool. Positive discrimination, such as hiring a less-qualified candidate because she is from an underrepresented group, is prohibited under the Equality Act. India is known as the first country to adopt affirmative action policies. With colleagues, we built a global dataset of affirmative action policies around the world. In over half of the countries we studied, national protests and civic action emerged in support of or against the conduct of affirmative action policies. This suggests that the way forward may be to pursue soft over hard affirmative action measures — encouraging diversity without implementing quotas. \"Affirmative Action Policies to Increase Diversity Are Successful, but Controversial, Around the World,\" United Nations University, UNU Centre, UNU-WIDER, 2024-02-28, https://unu.edu/article/affirmative-action-policies-increase-diversity-are-successful-controversial-around-world.",

When University officials boast of \"looking for racism everywhere,\" as multicultural educator Greg Ricks did in a 1990 *Stanford Daily* interview, then perhaps the most sensible (and certainly the most predictable) response will be for white students to avoid dealing with such quarrelsome people. Certainly, no one has accused Stanford's admissions officers of being racist, so perhaps the real problem with affirmative action is that we are pretending to solve a problem that no longer exists. Perhaps the most tragic side effect of affirmative action is that very significant achievements of minority students can become compromised. A Stanford without affirmative action will be a Stanford in which the question of who belongs here will no longer need to be answered.",

As we await the decision of the current assault on the use of affirmative action in admissions, we must remember the history of the policy was to “ensure that applicants are treated equally without regard to race, color, religion or national origin.” Preventing institutions from considering race as a factor in admissions guarantees that applicants aren’t treated equally.

Socioeconomic-based affirmative action acknowledges the intersectionality of disadvantage. By considering factors like household income, parental education levels, and neighborhood resources, institutions can create pathways for individuals from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, many of whom belong to marginalized racial and ethnic groups.Socioeconomic-based approaches also promote holistic diversity. Unlike race-conscious admissions, which have faced legal challenges, socioeconomic-based affirmative action offers a more holistic approach to achieving diversity goals. Critics may argue that socioeconomic-based affirmative action neglects the unique challenges faced by marginalized racial and ethnic groups. Implementing socioeconomic-based affirmative action requires concerted efforts from federal agencies, academic institutions, and policymakers. Overall, socioeconomic-based affirmative action offers a promising approach to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in federal practices and beyond. By prioritizing socioeconomic status over race in admissions processes, institutions can address systemic barriers to access and opportunity while remaining compliant with legal standards.",

As with many current uses, dental applications for botulinum toxin therapy are provided “off label,” as doctors may use approved products for conditions not yet given the FDA nod. A majority of the medical conditions for which botulinum toxin has been approved land in the neurology and movement disorder realm, Aslam said, with dystonia and spasticity two chief disorders she treats with the injections. Patients sometimes opt for the therapy over other medications for their condition because they like the more localized approach with botulinum toxin injections, Aslam said.",

When integrating phone time into the classroom environment, it serves to teach students digital boundaries and enforces a positive screen time limit that will follow students off campus. Managing student behavior through the creation of this boundary for situational cell phone use helps establish designated phone use on campus, encouraging students to live a life where their phone is a tool they are not dependent on. One proven fact is that cell phones in school can help accelerate a student’s learning. Lastly, you should allow phones at middle and high school campuses because this allows students to document and build their memories and relationships as they grow and create a positive school life where they feel happy to attend every day.",

Some proactive arguments for cellphone use include accelerated learning, access to digital content, and a communication tool to parents for student safety. Science teachers, business education teachers, and students who are interested in information technology (IT) may find researching the inner components of a cell phone interesting. Learning what’s inside of a cell phone can be a way for students to learn about the technology they use every day, and how it can be beneficial for communication and networking. This includes choosing specific educational content for students, designating device-free time in classrooms and at home, and modeling proper expectations and behavior for phone use. Managing cell phones in schools should be a priority to protect the learning environment for students. However, poor classroom management and a lack of specific rules and routines for cellphone use can be disastrous to student learning outcomes.",

We don’t have control over people’s lives all of the time – we can hardly ban some kids from accessing phones for their entire childhood. That the effects of screens appears to be mediated through time use is born out from studies of television when it rolled out.

Student use of cell phones during an unfolding emergency can distract their attention from safety and emergency response directions being given by school staff. Therefore the use of cell phones by students and others in the immediate school community could potentially decrease, not increase, school safety during a crisis.

One of the biggest benefits of cellphones is their ability to give students access to educational resources. ### Cons of cellphone use. Some students use their phones to cheat on tests or plagiarize work, which can go against school policies and harm their own learning. Schools may face legal risks if students misuse their phones or if privacy issues arise due to phone use in the classroom. Cellphones can be useful tools in schools, but they also bring risks.

While attending community college after high school will mean you’ll still be hitting the books, there are numerous benefits to attending community college as an alternative to a traditional four-year university degree program. Trade schools, also known as technical colleges, offer specific vocational training for skilled labor careers. Like an internship program, apprenticeships allow you to gain hands-on experience while learning valuable career skills. You’ll also want to pair learning these skills with some on-the-job training or work experience to get a foot in the door of your dream career field. Whether your post-high school graduation path includes college or one of the options above, it’s important to remember that there are many pathways to success. Beyond learning more about your skills and aptitudes, the ASVAB CEP also helps you gain a deeper understanding of your interests, values, career options, and the many ways to achieve your goals.",

Michael Jordan: Who’s the greatest of all time? ##### LeBron James’ two-plus decades of effort to establish himself as a contender for the greatest basketball player of all time have paid off. Both James and Jordan are amazing offensive players that can dominate games like few others. James is also a better passer than Jordan ever was. Providing teammates with key assists are a big part of James’s game, whereas Jordan was always seen as more of a selfish player. It took until 2019 for someone (James) to pass Jordan on the NBA’s all-time scoring records for most points scored on average during a season. Jordan won the NBA finals MVP award six times, compared to James’s four times. Sure James is now the NBA top scorer of all time, but Jordan was known as a king at scoring the game-winning shot in the final seconds of play. **The Bottom Line:** While Jordan was more of a flashy individual talent, James is a fantastic team player.",

Opponents of instant replay like former FIFA President Sepp Blatter argue that refereeing mistakes add to the \"fascination and popularity of football.\" It has been proposed that instant replay be limited to use in penalty incidents, fouls which lead to bookings or red cards and whether the ball has crossed the goal line, since those events are more likely than others to be game-changing.

In the proposed 1985 system, a replay official would have monitored the game feed from an in-stadium booth and initiated all reviews, reversing a call only with “indisputable visual evidence.”. Instant replay’s first regular season saw an average of 1.6 reviews per game. “My buddy, the instant replay guy,” Williams jokingly said after the game. Instant replay review was back in the NFL. Instant replay is an accepted part of the game,” said Atlanta Falcons general manager and Competition Committee Co-Chairman Rich McKay.

Professional athletes competing for money rather than for excellence will take the soul and magic out of sports, ruining it in the long run – for athletes and for fans.

After a 2-page summary of Wenger’s statistics as a player (1969-1981), we get the league records and standings for each team Wenger managed, from his first season at Nancy (1984) to his last at Arsenal (2018), a summary of his accomplishments at Arsenal, a list of every player who appeared for Arsenal during Wenger’s tenure, and a list of the top ten transfer fees paid by Arsenal during his time. In some ways, *Wenger: My Life and Lessons in Red and White*is written particularly with Arsenal fans in mind, assuming they can fill in gaps in the narrative from memory while Wenger tries to mollify their disappointment at the club maintaining a top-four level without ever claiming a league championship during his last fourteen years managing Arsenal FC.",

Wenger’s arrival would mark the beginning of a significant cultural shift—one that would change not just the way football was played, but how players approached every aspect of their professional lives. Dein had recognised Wenger’s potential early on, admiring his cerebral approach to football and his broad knowledge of the game across various cultures. From the very beginning, Wenger was clear in his vision—he wanted Arsenal to play fluid, attacking football that blended technical finesse with tactical discipline.

From a football perspective, he gave us trophies, amazing players, and beautiful attacking football, the likes of which the Premier League had never quite seen. Wenger shepherded us through more than a decade of relative austerity, in which he maintained fiscal prudence as we paid for the stadium, worked with what little money was available to him and ensured Champions League football, year over year.

It argues that colleges involved in revenue-generating college sports should expect college athletes to be students first, encourage them to earn pay for their names, images, and likenesses (NILs), and strike a better balance between providing education to athletes and entertainment to the public. College athletes should be paid because they generate significant revenue for their institutions, invest extensive time and effort in their sports, and often face financial stress despite receiving scholarships. Paying college athletes could reduce their financial stress, allow them to focus on their studies and sports without needing additional jobs, and encourage them to complete their education before going professional.",

Although college athletes are now allowed to profit from NIL contracts, they still cannot receive pay-to-play salaries from their schools. Many college athletes receive sports scholarships, which are meant to be a form of compensation for their work. Next, take a look at the arguments in favor of paying college athletes for their work — with the emphasis on the word “work.” Collegiate sports do indeed represent a considerable commitment of time and effort, often resembling a full-time job. If few college athletes receive scholarships and fewer still receive full scholarships, and considering that playing college sports can be equivalent to a full-time job, then an argument could indeed be made that college athletes should receive salaries for their work.",

The primary financial compensation student athletes receive is a scholarship that pays all or part of their tuition and other college-related expenses. Division III sports programs do not award sports scholarships, although other forms of financial aid are available to student athletes at these schools. The NCAA imposes strict rules for recruiting student athletes and provides a guide to help students determine their eligibility to play college sports. Once a student has received a scholarship offer from a college or university, the person may sign a national letter of intent (NLI), which is a voluntary, legally binding contract between an athlete and the school committing the student to enroll and play the designated sport for that school only.",

It’s a seismic shift that’s redefining what it means to be a college athlete and sparking a nationwide conversation about fairness, money and the future of amateur sports. NIL stands for “name, image and likeness,” a term that describes a college athlete’s right to earn money from their personal brand. These groups help athletes navigate contracts, ensure compliance with state and NCAA rules and sometimes even provide financial education to manage their earnings responsibly. Although NIL deals are fully legal, they come with financial responsibilities that many young athletes are encountering for the first time. For many athletes, NIL has turned college sports into an early introduction to entrepreneurship. Universities, collectives and athletes are increasingly turning to financial advisors, accountants and attorneys to navigate contracts, taxes and compliance rules.",

As Jon Solomon, Editorial Director for the Sports and Society Program at the Aspen Institute explained, “The most glaring example occurred when the University of North Carolina was found by outside parties to have organized fake classes that enabled dozens of athletes to gain and maintain their eligibility… of the 3,100 students who took the fake classes over 18 years, 47.4 percent were athletes… North Carolina avoided NCAA penalties by essentially arguing that the NCAA should stay out of irregularities in college courses.” The NCAA polices athletes’ finances but does not ensure a quality education.

Still, it looked like Washington would lose when the Oilers lined up to try a 33-yard field goal with four seconds left in a 13-13 game. Washington came out fast in the NFC Championship Game, with Riggs finishing off a drive with a 2-yard touchdown run. Washington looked ready to grab an early lead when Rypien appeared to finish an 89-yard touchdown drive with a third-down scoring pass to Monk. In an era when the NFC East had some great teams—Roger Staubach’s Dallas Cowboys and the legendary Over-The-Hill Gang of the Washington Redskins, it was actually the old St. Louis Cardinals football team who came into 1976 as the two-time defending division champs.",

Defensive teams only appeared in three Super Bowls, their only win coming from a team led by Patrick Mahomes (and the two losses coming against his offenses). The only teams to win their conference that got worse on offense (outside of that strange 2021 Super Bowl) had such strong regular season performances that they simply couldn’t keep up the pace in the playoffs (‘18 LAR, ‘20 KC, ‘23 SF). If this were the case, though, it would be expected that the inverse is also true: offensive performance should degrade as well, assuming teams with better defenses make the playoffs. The fact of the matter is that defensive performance doesn’t matter as much as offense does in the playoffs; you can play worse than you did in the regular season, and still come away with conference and Super Bowl championships as long as your offense plays well.",

Congressional sponsors, as noted, claim that the substitution of broad-based federal taxation for private health insurance costs would result in most American families paying less for health care than they do today. For example, scholars at the Urban Institute, a prominent liberal-leaning think tank, estimated that a single-payer program would require a federal spending increase of $34 trillion over ten years, and total American health care spending would increase by $7 trillion. In summary, the adoption of a single-payer system covering more than 330 million Americans, particularly as outlined in the leading House and Senate bills, would guarantee a massive disruption of existing public and private health care coverage and delivery systems.",

Because appeals processes in many countries are lengthy, death row inmates frequently are exposed to such conditions for many years while they await final disposition of their cases and execution of their punishment.",

After dividing states into two groups, permanent disenfranchisement or voting rights restoration post-release, they found that individuals were approximately 10% less likely to recidivate if they were released in automatic restoration states versus permanent disenfranchisement states.17 Hamilton-Smith and Vogel posit that felony disenfranchisement creates community reintegration barriers for justice-impacted individuals which becomes an additional contributor to future criminality. In 2023, Minnesota and New Mexico restored the right to vote for over 57,000 justice-impacted persons who are on felony probation or parole.35 In 2020, Washington, DC, became the third jurisdiction in the continental United States where individuals incarcerated for a felony conviction can vote.36 While this is progress, felony disenfranchisement remains deeply entrenched in this country.",

Only nine U.S. states have laws that allow the state to disenfranchise people with felony convictions permanently (though the state may also choose to allow those with felony convictions to vote), while 15 states allow re-enfranchisement after prison, parole, and probation are complete.",

The U.S. House’s impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump’s interactions with the president of Ukraine comes more than two decades after the last presidential impeachment crisis – the one that engulfed President Bill Clinton in 1998 and early 1999. One key difference between the Clinton impeachment and Richard Nixon’s experience a quarter-century earlier is that Clinton’s job approval ratings were already quite high before the scandal broke, and by and large they remained so. Clinton’s approval hit 71% again in mid-December, *after* the House vote to impeach him. Clinton’s impeachment process was generally unpopular, according to Center surveys during that time. Roughly three-in-ten or fewer Americans supported impeaching Clinton throughout autumn 1998 and even into mid-December, just before the House did so anyway. The Center’s results were consistent with polling by other organizations, which typically found between a quarter and a third of Americans favoring Clinton’s impeachment.",

Each year since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on January 1, 1994, officials in Canada, Mexico, and the United States have regularly declared the agreement to be an unqualified success. NAFTA, while extending protections for investors, explicitly excluded any protections for working people in the form of labor standards, worker rights, and the maintenance of social investments. These reports, based in part on more comprehensive labor market surveys in all three countries,1 show that the impact on workers in each nation has been different according to their circumstances. Contrary to what the American promoters of NAFTA promised U.S. workers, the agreement did not result in an increased trade surplus with Mexico, but the reverse. As Bruce Campbell of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives reports, Canada’s increased market integration with the United States began in 1989 with the bilateral Free Trade Agreement, the precursor to NAFTA.",

In a recent study that de-emphasized the impact of NAFTA on the U.S. economy, economists David Autor (MIT), David Dorn (University of Zurich) and Gordon Hanson (University of California, San Diego) stress the role of China’s emergence on job growth and wages in the U.S. In the study, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, they write: “China’s emergence as a great economic power has induced an epochal shift in patterns of world trade.",

Every Latin American leader, from Carlos Menem in Argentina to Patricio Aylwin in Chile, has voiced support for free trade with the U.S. The Clinton Administration should begin negotiating free trade agreements with them.",

Months earlier, a co-worker whose job entailed making steel plates that were fed into a machine to make a lock body told Bink that the plates were now being shipped to Master Lock’s plant in Nogales, Mexico. “People ran for the gate,” Bink, who was then the president of Local 469, says. “They thought the plant was finished.” Bink managed to hang on, but NAFTA fundamentally changed the balance of power between Master Lock and its workers.",

And the Hibakusha are Living Proof.\nOutrider Foundation\n599 subscribers\n22 likes\n1149 views\n15 Aug 2022\nSome arrived in wheelchairs.\n\nEven the ones who walked carried scars from burns they received during the nuclear blast.\n\nHaruka Noishiki met them when she was just nine years old on a school field trip to Nagasaki. They are called the Hibakusha–survivors of the United States' World War II nuclear attack on Japan. \n\nFor Noishiki, the Hibakusha embodied what was considered self-evident in Japan–that the nuclear strikes on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II were an atrocity. \n\nBut, during high school, after Noishiki and her family relocated to the United States, she discovered history's first and only nuclear wartime bombing was being taught not as an atrocity but as a necessary evil. And the fact that the U.S. continued to manufacture nuclear weapons was discussed as something that still might contribute to good in the world, depending on how it served American interests.\n\n\"After hearing what the Hibakusha went through,\" says Noishiki, \"I knew there was no way to justify the indifference to human life necessary for nuclear weapons to exist.\" \n\nBut while many share Noishiki's sentiments, the U.S. and eight other countries continue to manufacture and maintain nuclear weapons–some of them as much as 60 times more powerful than the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki 72 years ago. For Noishiki, this fact betrays a dangerous denial. \n\n\"If we're not honest with ourselves about the impact of human suffering caused by our collective decisions,\" says Noishiki, \"How can we prevent the same suffering, now and in the future? What I keep coming back to is the amount of money that's invested in the creation of these weapons. Think of what that money could do instead.\"\n\nEach year, the United States spends $60 billion on nuclear weapons. \n\n\"That money could be invested in equalizing healthcare, incentivizing sustainability, and strengthening public education,\" says Noishiki. \"It just doesn't make any sense to spend defense dollars this way when, around the world, wildfires force thousands from their homes, rising sea levels wash away communities, and droughts devastate agriculture.\"\n\nFor Noishiki, our only hope lives in the power of nuclear survivors to tell their stories. And those stories aren't limited to those of the Hibakusha. \n\n\"There are nuclear victims much like them today right here in the U.S.,\" says Noishiki. \"Here in America, people in communities downwind of nuclear weapons sites are still developing cancer after being exposed to soil, water, and air contaminated by nuclear fallout and waste. Just as I listened to the stories of the Hibakusha as a child, the stories of these survivors—and those who didn't survive—need to be told as well.\"\n\n// \n\nOutrider supports multimedia storytelling about nuclear threats and climate change\n\nPROJECTS\n✍️ Outrider Projects: https://outrider.org/projects\n\nNEWSLETTER\n🌎 Subscribe: https://outrider.org/newsletter\n\nCONNECT\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/outriderfdn/\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/outrider.org\nhttps://www.facebook.com/outriderfdn/\nhttps://x.com/outriderfdn\nhttps://www.threads.net/outriderfdn\nhttps://www.instagram.com/outriderfdn/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@OutriderFdn\n\nRESOURCES \n☢️Nuclear Weapons: https://outrider.org/nuclear-weapons\n🔋Climate Change: https://outrider.org/climate-change\n13 comments\n",

His defenders included journalist Glenn Greenwald, *The Guardian* reporter who first published documents provided by Snowden that detail the NSA PRISM program to monitor the phone calls and emails of US citizens. “I never imagined that I would live to see our courts condemn the NSA’s activities as unlawful,” Snowden tweeted after the 2020 ruling. According to a May 2013 criminal complaint, the American government charged Snowden under the Espionage Act of 1917 with theft of government property, unauthorized communication of national defense information, and willful communication of classified communications intelligence information to an unauthorized person.",

Orwellian discourse: One kind of conflict occurs when politically correct norms lead to the kind of abuse of language that Orwell criticizes in “Politics of the English Language.” We noted earlier that the petty misapplication of language-norms isn’t worth making a fuss over, but as Orwell points out, the vague and imprecise use of terms like “fascism” can come to serve as a “defense of the indefensible.”(1946 p.162) Contemporary versions of this on the right are easily recognized, as when a kill list becomes a “disposition matrix,” but political correctness seems to involve a similar tendency.",

As a result, some people will complain that they don’t want to speak up because they fear being “criticized” or “stigmatized.” These people should recognize that their fear isn’t a sign of the environment’s political correctness or hostility toward free expression; it’s just a sign that they need more courage—for it requires courage to stay engaged with difference.",

When you are deciding whether to use an intervention, you should think about whether it is more helpful than harmful, or if the benefits outweigh the costs, not just whether it is helpful. Some people might think that the positive effects outweigh the side effets or costs and therefore may be more likely to decide to use the medicine. Others may think that the side effects would not be tolerable or worth the risk, so they may be more likely to decide not to use the medicine.

Social welfare policy refers to government programs that help ensure the health of a society and those who live in it. In the United States, social welfare policy is what would later inspire programs like Medicare, Medicaid and housing assistance. Social welfare policy includes programs that are distributive and redistributive:. * **Redistributive** **social welfare policy**, also referred to as welfare programs, offers assistance to those who meet income qualifications.

But as the U.S. population ages, the burden of financing retirement benefits on American workers is set to increase.[88] To avoid this, Social Security should be better focused on assuring a floor of income to retirees, while Medicare should be reformed to ensure that costs are considered before additional health-care services are added to its standard benefit package.[89] Better targeting can also improve the effectiveness of assistance for the unemployed, while alleviating the payroll-tax burden on current workers.[90].",

The Supreme Court has interpreted this clause to place primary responsibility with the states for redistricting, but it also clearly preserves the ability of Congress to set federal rules as appropriate. Numerous states have had to redistrict following judicial rulings that their maps violate principles of the Constitution or other laws around redistricting. In Rucho v Common Cause (2019), the Supreme Court held that claims of partisan gerrymandering present political questions beyond the reach of federal courts, effectively leaving it up to plaintiffs to prove that any redistricting harm stems from something beyond party affiliation. Redistricting is a state process but is also governed by the U.S. Constitution, federal law, and judicial precedent. In most states, the legislature is responsible for drawing both their congressional and legislative district lines, typically through the standard lawmaking process and often subject to gubernatorial veto.",

In sum, these results support our hypothesis that independent redistricting commissions are generally perceived as less biased than partisan-controlled maps – an attitude that could foster broader legitimacy and trust in the electoral process. In particular, we find that legislature-led redistricting has a significant negative effect on perceived map legitimacy for individuals who consider independent commissions to increase the fairness of elections in the United States (i.e., respondents who score a “4” or a “5” on this moderator variable). As gerrymandering continues to threaten electoral responsiveness and public confidence, promoting independent, non-partisan redistricting processes emerges as a critical step toward safeguarding democracy – not only by changing the map but also by restoring the public’s trust in the legitimacy of political institutions.",

If all policies are effectively implemented, China will be able to maintain high growth, to reduce inequality, poverty, and corruption, to improve production efficiency and the environment.

Multiple opinions have pointed towards India's rapid economic development as a reason for it to be considered a potential superpower, in particular during the 2010s when it was predicted to outpace China's growth into the future.

The United States is the one country today whose global superpower status is undisputed. According to Tufts University political scientist Michael Beckley, long-term economic growth depends upon a country’s geography, demography (people), and political institutions, and the United States is better positioned than competing powers in all three categories, being “big (geographically), young, and highly educated” with a healthier government than competing superpowers. Some experts argue that China will pass the United States as a global superpower in the coming decades. Others argue that Russia is not even a potential superpower because it has the trade relations of a Third World country, a much smaller GDP than China or the United States, and no highly rated universities, among other things.",

Mr. Douthat is an Opinion columnist and the host of the “Interesting Times” podcast. I tend to be pretty skeptical of this scenario: America has outlasted challengers before and China seems to me to have remarkable strengths, yes, but also serious weaknesses. Dan Wang is a keen observer of contemporary China, and his new book,” Breakneck: China’s Quest to Engineer the Future,” argues that the Trump administration’s current trade war is wrongheaded or too late, and that American pre-eminence can be preserved if we imitate the things that China is getting right. *Below is an edited transcript of an episode of “Interesting Times.” We recommend listening to it in its original form for the full effect.",

General Assembly, host Landry Signé interviews members of the U.N. and its partners on how the organization upholds international peace and security, including through its developmental support to fragile states. In this conclusion, my guests and I discuss the United Nations’ support for international peace and security, the main reason for its founding back in 1945, and we consider what our world might have looked like without the UN and the forum it provides for countries to diplomatically resolve disputes and seek assistance with domestic conflicts. **SIGNÉ:** Next I spoke with the assistant secretary general of the Commonwealth, who was adamant regarding the continued value of the United Nations for all its member countries, particularly in the area of peace and security.",

The UN’s history, says Stone, is studded with episodes when consensus among the Security Council’s permanent members enabled real breakthroughs. “The muscle behind that,” says Stone, “came from the Truman administration, which threatened to withhold Marshall Plan funds from the Netherlands if it failed to comply, but there also was a united front of the five permanent members.”. The Security Council structure, Stone says, reflects an unavoidable dilemma: Cooperative solutions to international conflict require agreement between the major powers. “We need every instrument we have,” Stone says, “and the only global institutions that are engaging very effectively with climate change right now are UN institutions.”. The UN Security Council has 15 members: 5 permanent members—China, France, Russia, the UK, and the US (all hold veto power)—and 10 non-permanent members elected for two-year terms by the General Assembly.",

The Arab Spring was unavoidable, however, due to the single underlying problem that plagues most countries in the region – stagnant authoritarian governments. With that in mind, let us examine three relevant factors in charting the trajectory of Arab politics: the origins of the Arab Spring, the retrenchment of authoritarianism, and finally what the next wave of revolts might look like. The origins of the Arab Spring tell us much about the underlying political decay of authoritarianism that continues to afflict the region. The political regimes targeted by the Arab Spring protest movements were an assorted cohort of nondemocratic governments.",

The initial Arab Spring was “like one giant Woodstock,” said Alaoui. “People might think that the region is stagnant, that we’ve simply gone back to the bad old days of Hosni Mubarak or other Arab autocrats who were exemplars of ossification and stagnation, but that masks a lot of change in the region currently happening,” said Tarek Masoud, Kennedy School Professor of Public Policy and the Sultan Qaboos bin Said of Oman Professor of International Relations. “The drivers of the change are not the photogenic, admirable, creative young people who brought us the Arab Spring,” he said. “My belief is that the Saudi government looked at these uprisings of young people across the region and said, ‘If we don’t change things, we are going to find that happening here, and we’re not going to be able to weather it,’” said Masoud.",

In a recent survey in 10 Arab nations (Algeria, Morocco, Libya, Tunisia, Egypt, Sudan, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Palestinian Territories),1 we measured public attitudes toward the Arab Spring protests, its goals, and its beneficiaries. In our survey, respondents were asked to rank the goals of the Arab Spring protests from a list that includes increasing political freedoms, reducing corruption, enhancing dignity, improving the economic situation, and promoting social justice, among others. On average, fewer than 20 percent of respondents agreed that the goals of economic improvement and social justice were reached, despite ranking these as the top two goals of the Arab Spring protests. Survey respondents’ views on how various ethno-religious groups benefited from or were harmed by the Arab Spring process reveal notable signs of the way these groups are perceived by the society at large (Figure 8).",

But with active presidents, Reagan among them, the verdict of history is likely to be many years in the coming. On all the major social issues-abortion, quotas, gay rights, feminism, crime and punishment, the family, moral and religious values-the Reagan administration has been conservative and correct, even if reasonable people might quarrel over details of policy and political strategy. All told, in my judgment as a conservative Democrat, President Reagan will be remembered more for the opportunities that slipped from his grasp than for achievements that reshaped the American political landscape. Reagan has indeed been as conservative a president as we could realistically hope to have but not a great one.",

Before we start looking at the Reagan legacies, we should recall what America was like in 1981 when Ronald Reagan became president. Ronald Reagan did this by lowering taxes, by reducing government regulation and interference in the economy, and by making it easier for individuals to accumulate the money they can use for new economic enterprises. The rebuilding of the American arsenal has changed what the Soviets at one time liked to call the \"global correlation of forces.\" This correlation now has tilted toward the U.S. This should please and reassure America's friends around the world-and certainly here in China.",

In a case about the constitutionality of a tariff on goods trafficked between the island and the mainland, the U.S. Supreme Court defined Puerto Rico in 1901 as “foreign to the United States in a domestic sense” because it was neither a state of the American union nor an independent republic. As the U.S. and Puerto Rico mark the anniversary of the invasion on July 25, 2023, the island maintains a status similar to a colony because it lacks sovereignty and full representation in the federal government.

While there are estimates that Ukraine would need around 150,000 European troops to effectively deter Russia6, these troops would need to be ready to be deployed rapidly to wherever Russia might decide to attack the EU. The current assumption of NATO military planners (RAND, 2024) is that in case of a Russian attack on a European NATO country, 100,000 US troops stationed in Europe would be rapidly augmented by up to 200,000 additional US troops, concentrated in US armoured units best suited for the East European battlefield. Military equipment spending is currently about 0.7 percent of GDP (Wolff *et al*, 2024); it would need to increase substantially.",

According to Rufus King, “It was with the people that the Constitution meant to place the election of the Chief Magistrate.” The Constitution’s Electoral College Clause (Article II, section 1, clause 3) stipulates that electors from each state shall elect the president. However, most states adopted popular election of presidential electors in the 1810s and 1820s. Abolishing the Electoral College, however, would change the structure of the presidency to make it easier for popularly elected presidents to concentrate power in the executive branch. But the fact remains that a majority of the Electoral College elect’s presidents, not a majority of all Americans.

In May of 2019, the Washington State Supreme Court **upheld** a state election law that said an elector who did not vote for the candidate he pledged to support could be fined up to $1,000 in civil penalties. If that occurs, the court might provide states additional guidance on just how much leeway they have to impact the Electoral College vote that decides the presidency of the United States.",

If no candidate wins the necessary 270 electoral votes, the House of Representatives convenes in a “contingent election” and determines the winner with each state delegation getting one vote. Most controversies involving the Electoral College occurred when candidates win the popular vote but lose the Electoral College vote. The NPVIC is a legally binding agreement among states to award the electoral votes from their state to the national popular vote winner, regardless of whether the majority of voters in that state preferred another candidate. The NPVIC would only go into effect should the states in the agreement represent an electoral majority of at least 270 electoral votes. Currently, candidates focus on a handful of “battleground” states such as Ohio and Florida with close vote-margins and large electoral vote payouts.",

The Electoral College was also intended to prevent states with larger populations from having undue influence and to compromise between electing the president by popular vote and letting Congress choose the president. Even Donald Trump, who benefited from the Electoral College system, stated after the 2016 presidential election that he believed presidents should be chosen by popular vote: “I would rather see it where you went with simple votes.

Toft calls this the rise of kinetic diplomacy, “the use of force first over other tools of state.” She says, “Traditionally, you think of diplomacy first and use of force as last. Pointing to U.S. involvements in Vietnam and Afghanistan, neither of which ended in victory, she says, “It's much more difficult today.” That’s another argument for reconsidering the increased reliance on military intervention. Toft likens the current state of U.S. foreign policy to a game of whack-a-mole, in which the U.S. sees issues popping up and has “only one way of dealing with them, which is the hammer” of military force.",

In fact, of the over 250 military interventions carried out by the U.S. since 1789, only five have been declared wars.24 In the post-Cold War world, the U.S. military must be prepared for all manner of military interventions, including limited conventional warfare (Panama 1989 and Desert Storm), punitive airstrikes (Libya 1986 and Iraq 1993), deterrence (Kuwait 1994), shows of force (Persian Gulf 1988 and Philippines 1989), and support for peace operations (when their goals are clearly defined and they serve the national interest).",

The U.S. Army deployed 100,000 (mostly National Guard \"National Guard (United States)\")) troops under General Elwell Otis to the Philippines, resulting in the poorly armed and poorly trained rebels to break off into armed bands. Over 2,400 Americans, 18 CIA operatives, and over 1,800 civilian contractors, died in the Afghan War. The war in Afghanistan became the longest war in United States history, lasting 19 years and ten months–surpassing the length of the Vietnam War, which lasted 19 years and five months–and cost the U.S. over $2 trillion. Though \"Operation Enduring Freedom\" (OEF) usually refers to the 2001–2014 phase of the War in Afghanistan \"War in Afghanistan (2001–2021)\"), the term is also the U.S. military's official name for the war on terror, and has multiple subordinate operations which see American military forces deployed in regions across the world in the name of combating terrorism, often in collaboration with the host nation's central government via security cooperation and status of forces agreements:.",

In Sudan, if the war-related famine again becomes severe, dividing the country into an Arab north and a Christian south may save the vast majority of threatened Sudanese lives at the lowest cost in dollars—and in the blood of intervening troops. But muscular interventions in wars like those in Angola and Congo will probably not happen until more countries develop the military capabilities for such operations—which brings us to the final question. Although the United States need not create a specialized armed force for peace operations, it should modify its military force structure to lessen the strain of various types of limited missions around the world. Even if such countries cannot be expected to lead forcible interventions, they can provide valuable combat forces that enable peacekeeping missions to uphold ceasefires and peace accords under challenge.",

For many, the Iraq case shows that “nation-building is impossible” and that military interventions are not worth the effort and usually turn into “endless wars.” Moreover, the problem in Iraq was not just that America could not achieve the lofty goals of democracy; rather, the United States, despite tens of billions of dollars spent and the work of thousands of trainers, could not build a functioning Iraqi Army, an essential part of the clear/hold/build strategy. Despite the objections in the U.S. field manual, the American experience in Iraq provides a paradigmatic case of community mobilization with the “flipping” of Bedouin tribes from cooperation with AQI to alliance with the United States.",

But in the town of Gori, where he was born, the city council recently decided to re-erect a huge statue of Stalin, which the pro-Western government of President Mikheil Saakashvili took down almost three years ago. But Olga Tochishvili, who has worked as a guide here since the Soviet era, says attitudes towards Stalin are changing. \"In Georgia, most of the old generation like Stalin. A few weeks ago the city council allocated funds to re-erect the statue at the Stalin museum. Gori's new mayor, David Razuadze, from Georgian Dream says Stalin's statue will be re-installed by the summer. \"People in Gori have this feeling that the name Stalin is known in the world and so is their little town… Georgia is known worldwide because of Stalin. And so it is understandable why people are still in this Soviet way of thinking, that Stalin was 'Our Boy', a very strong leader.\".",

When President Obama left office on January 20, 2017, his impact and legacy were unclear. With Republicans in control of both the presidency and the Congress in 2017, however, some of Obama’s most notable achievements—the Affordable Care Act, the Paris climate change agreement, and Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals—were overturned or under attack. Obama’s lasting impact on American life may turn out to have been greatest in terms of the crises that did not happen. In a C-SPAN survey of 91 historians, political scientists, and other presidential scholars, Obama was ranked 12th among all presidents since George Washington for the overall quality of his performance as chief executive. Bush, who ranked 33rd, Bill Clinton (15th), and George H.W.

And from then on, the Obama presidency struggled under a radicalized Republican Party. Coleman notes, “In the summer of 2012, under pressure from party activists to show some effort on immigration reform before the November election and unable to rise above the partisanship that dominated Washington as he had hoped, President Obama turned to his executive powers and announced the creation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.” But again we see the weakness of executive action.",

President Obama promised that he would make quality, affordable health care not a privilege, but a right. The President has refocused and reaffirmed American leadership in the world, recognizing that American strength derives not only from our military power but also our economic vitality, the depth and breadth of our global partnerships, and our values. President Obama has fought to make sure America’s founding promise — that all of us are created equal — ring true for every American.

Throughout history, protests have played a crucial role in advocating for change, with notable examples like the Boston Tea Party, the Salt March led by Mahatma Gandhi, and the March on Washington for civil rights. ## Protest. No matter what the intent, protest can take on many potential forms, often ranging from individual demonstrations to mass gatherings of people who assemble in support of a particular cause. Between March and April 1930, Indian activist Mahatma Gandhi carried out the Salt March, an influential act of nonviolent civil disobedience in protest of British rule in India. The three major forms of protest are civil disobedience, nonviolent protest, and violent protest. Acts of civil disobedience may be carried out by individuals or whole groups of protesters. Such protests often come in the form of demonstrations, marches, and vigils. When peaceful demonstrations fail to make an impact, violent protests sometimes become inevitable.",

This implies that concessions by elites to protester demands will be more likely during peak cycles of protest.”  The author analyzed whether protest is systematically related to two types of concessions: establishing a CRB and lowering fatalities of minorities. The author ultimately found that protests influence cities to establish more powerful citizen oversight boards and that they lower fatalities in minority communities.

What we’re overwhelmingly observing is an extremely low number of injuries, property damage or arrests, particularly if you consider that tens of thousands of protests have taken place in the country since Donald Trump was inaugurated the second time. And we do think we’re seeing a shift in the willingness of people in pro-Trump areas in the country to participate in a broader mass movement emerging in opposition to many of his administration’s policies. So, during, the whole of Trump’s first term, the average protest participation was something like 40 people per 10,000 in a county.",

In a recent study, we show that such approval is associated with higher public support and perceived legitimacy for a strike, which is cross-nationally consistent in France and the U.S. Variation in the use and constraint of drones suggests four patterns of strikes that are emerging globally. Fourth, countries can use drones *tactically* with *multilateral* constraint, adopting what we call juridical strikes. The treatment groups varied a fictional country’s drone strike in terms of use (tactical or strategic), constraint (unilateral or multilateral), and civilian casualty (yes or no). Sensitivity to civilian casualties also constitutes nearly 7.5% of French respondents’ perceptions for legitimate drone strikes. These findings have implications for French and U.S. strikes while also providing insights for countries’ evolving use of drones.",

Professor Cleveland said that the administration has claimed that these groups have joined with Al-Qaeda in the fight against the United States and thus should be treated as “co-belligerents.” Professor Koh then turned the discussion to Daniel Cahen to focus on how force may be used — i.e., assuming one has resolved the various issues raised by Professor Cleveland and has concluded that the use of lethal force is lawful.",

Repeated drone strikes over the past two weeks in Port Sudan have damaged key infrastructure across the crucial Sudanese aid hub, disrupted humanitarian operations, and placed civilians in danger, a UN-appointed human rights expert has warned. “These ongoing attacks on critical infrastructure are putting lives at risk, worsening the humanitarian crisis, and violating basic human rights,” said Radhouane Nouicer, the designated expert on the human rights situation in Sudan, appointed by UN rights office OHCHR. A drone strike on the Port Sudan airport forced the UN to temporarily suspend aid flights and the movement of humanitarian personnel. Similar strikes have been reported in North River Nile and White Nile states, where power stations have allegedly been targeted by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia, which has been battling Government troops during a brutal civil war for control of Sudan. “Civilian infrastructure is protected under international law and must never be a target,” he said.",

This installment of the Russian Firepower Striker Tracker explores the cost-effectiveness of long-range attack drones used in the Russia-Ukraine war. And the United States will need to learn from Ukraine how to counter one-way attack drones while investing in its own family of low-cost, long-distance attack systems like the proposed Enterprise Test Vehicle—Pentagonese for a low-cost cruise missile under development—and Anduril’s new class of autonomous air vehicles. The data classified nearly all the one-way attack drones Russia launched against Ukraine as “Shahed-136/131.” Russia has ramped up domestic production of Shahed-type drones, which are cheaper and easier to produce than conventional missiles. First, the United States will need to determine the best support options for changing the cost-effectiveness of Shaheds in collaboration with European partners, including new forums given the uncertainty surrounding the Ukrainian Defense Contact Group.",

Putin came to call these people “state-appointed billionaires.” He saw them as a conduit for looting Russia, and sought to restore to the country what had been stolen from it. Putin became president a half a year after Yeltsin was maneuvered into allowing the dismemberment of Russia’s ally, Serbia, and as he entered office Putin said: “We will not tolerate any humiliation to the national pride of Russians, or any threat to the integrity of the country.”. The degradation of Russia’s position represented by the Serbian War is what Putin was alluding to when he famously described the collapse of the Soviet Union as “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century.” This statement is often misunderstood or mischaracterized: he did not mean by it any desire to return to Communism.",

Throughout, Stent analyzes Putin’s policymaking around key domestic and international developments to understand why Russia broke bad, the West’s role, and how should the United States deal with Russia in the future.

What’s out there in the universe beyond Earth? \n\nClick here to subscribe to our channel 👉🏽 https://bbc.in/3VyyriM\n\nThese are some of the questions which have plagued astronomers, and film producers, for years. \n\nWell, now astronomers are revisiting these questions following the discovery of a possible atmosphere around an Earth-sized planet about 40 light years away. The exoplanet is called Trappist-1e and may be able to host life. \n\nBBC science presenter Caroline Steel joins us to explain what we need to know about this discovery. Plus, we speak to Ximena from Venezuela and Vanessa from Finland - who are both members of the Cosmic Girls Foundation - about what they make of Trappist-1e. \n\n00:00 Coming up\n00:14 Intro\n00:45 Cool facts about space\n01:55 Discovery of a new exoplanet\n02:35 Chances of water\n03:07 Nitrogen in planets\n03:47 Reactions to the discovery\n05:59 Life outside the Earth\n07:25 Role of James Webb Space Telescope\n08:38 Next steps\n10:01 Possibilities of living in another planet \n\nWatch more episodes from What in the World here 👉🏽 https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz_B0PFGIn4eMOlGZclzdcHmv7s8BFQE6 \n\nInstagram: @bbcwhatintheworld\nEmail: whatintheworld@bbc.co.uk\nWhatsApp: +44 0330 12 33 22 6\nPresenter: Hannah Gelbart\nProducers: Mora Morrison and Chelsea Coates\nVideo Journalist: Baldeep Chahal\nEditor: Verity Wilde\n\n----------------\nThis is the official BBC World Service YouTube channel. \nIf you like what we do, you can also find us here:\nInstagram 👉🏽 https://www.instagram.com/bbcworldservice\nTwitter 👉🏽 https://twitter.com/bbcworldservice\nFacebook 👉🏽 https://facebook.com/bbcworldservice\nBBC World Service website 👉🏽 https://www.bbc.co.uk/worldserviceradio\n\nThanks for watching and subscribing!\n#BBCWorldService #WorldService #aliens #alienlife #space\n295 comments\n",

Suppose we do go to Mars, he says, and find living organisms in the subsurface that are DNA based, like life on Earth. The Clipper likely wouldn't be able to find life on Europa, but it could help make the case for a follow-up lander that could dig into the surface, studying its chemistry the way rovers have studied Mars's.",

Data from our early planet-finding missions, such as NASA’s Kepler and its extended incarnation, K2, or the James Webb Space Telescope, could yield bare bones evidence of the potentially habitable worlds. NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (formerly known as the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope, and scheduled to launch no later than May 2027), could zero in on a distant planet’s reflected light to detect the signatures of oxygen, water vapor, or some other powerful indication of possible life. To learn more about the advanced, space-based telescope technology — already in use, and being developed at NASA — to search for life among the stars, read about our planet hunters.

Dr Subir Sarkar, a lecturer in astrophysics at Cardiff University and part of the research team, said the research suggests K2-18b could have an ocean which could be potentially full of life - though he cautioned scientists \"don't know for sure\". He added that the research team's work will continue to focus on looking for life on other planets: \"Keep watching this space.\". But even if the Cambridge team obtains a five sigma result, that won't be conclusive proof that life exists on the planet, according to Prof Catherine Heymans of Edinburgh University and Scotland's Astronomer Royal, who is independent of the research team. The reason many researchers infer that the planet has a vast liquid ocean is the absence of the gas ammonia in K2-18b's atmosphere.",

Now, things like a coupon from a bond or a dividend from a stock or profits from a company can still see their returns *enhanced*by public sentiment (valuation, etc.), but even that I am often critical of …  The earnings stream of a company drives its returns, or cash flow of a piece of property or a loan, or whatever, and we price our investments around such fundamentals. The old expression, “those who know don’t tell, and those who tell don’t know” rings true here …  If one was so sure that something like a cryptocurrency embedded in the blockchain would see its unit value scream higher in price it escapes me as to why they would want others to believe the same thing when all that belief would do is drive the price higher, limiting their own return as they try to accumulate more.",

Each year since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on January 1, 1994, officials in Canada, Mexico, and the United States have regularly declared the agreement to be an unqualified success. NAFTA, while extending protections for investors, explicitly excluded any protections for working people in the form of labor standards, worker rights, and the maintenance of social investments. These reports, based in part on more comprehensive labor market surveys in all three countries,1 show that the impact on workers in each nation has been different according to their circumstances. Contrary to what the American promoters of NAFTA promised U.S. workers, the agreement did not result in an increased trade surplus with Mexico, but the reverse. As Bruce Campbell of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives reports, Canada’s increased market integration with the United States began in 1989 with the bilateral Free Trade Agreement, the precursor to NAFTA.",

In a recent study that de-emphasized the impact of NAFTA on the U.S. economy, economists David Autor (MIT), David Dorn (University of Zurich) and Gordon Hanson (University of California, San Diego) stress the role of China’s emergence on job growth and wages in the U.S. In the study, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, they write: “China’s emergence as a great economic power has induced an epochal shift in patterns of world trade.",

In response to changing political dynamics, especially after the 2016 U.S. elections, discussions around reforming NAFTA culminated in the creation of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) in 2018, which aimed to address some of the criticisms while retaining many principles of NAFTA. ## North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and new markets. *The North American Free Trade Agreement significantly altered the economic relationship among businesses in the United States, Canada, and Mexico by approximating the conditions of a common market.

Unions’ ability to limit the labor supply to firms so as to extract above-market wages can benefit workers but be detrimental to firms and employment. This article outlines the pros and cons of union wage bargaining, with empirical evidence on the size of effects across countries and over time. Nevertheless, as in the Anglo-American setting, the wage premium achieved through local bargaining is a function of union bargaining power (often indicated by the proportion of employees belonging to the union) and the financial gains that are available from the employer, as in the case of France. Although, in theory, it may be unsustainable to pay above-market wages, unions can benefit workers and firms alike if the wage premium reflects union-induced increases in productivity (see Factors affecting the impact of union wage effects on firm performance).",

In contrast to the incremental changes seen in U.S. adults’ support of unions over time, the new poll documents an unprecedented uptick since the prior measure, in 2018, in perceptions that unions in the country will become stronger in the future than they are today. Republicans are much more likely to want unions to have less rather than more influence, but the 21% today who want them to have more influence roughly ties with last year’s 22% record high. Labor unions are enjoying a moment of high public approval and strong belief in the benefits they offer to workers, businesses and the economy. Nine percent of U.S. workers belong to a labor union, according to aggregated data from Gallup's 2023-2024 Work and Education surveys.",

Investment banking has lost its cachet, and the only people applying to do it are people who want to be investment bankers.

It’s also important to know that you can purchase shares in real estate investments without the headaches of actually buying, managing and selling properties. There are lots of metrics you can look at when figuring out if investing in real estate or stocks will make you more money. * Real estate investments can be more work than stocks.

You can also invest in different real estate markets or types of real estate, like rental properties, fix-and-flips, or REITs. * **Hire a property management company:** You can invest in residential and commercial real estate, then hire a property management company to handle the properties, making your income completely passive. * **Invest in REITs:** Real estate investment trusts allow real estate investors to invest money in commercial and large residential real estate projects without the responsibility of managing the properties, providing 100% passive income. Real estate can be a good investment if you research the market, know the area, and buy properties you can afford and manage. Check with a real estate agent and lender in your area to identify the right type of first investment property for you and the amount you can safely borrow based on your income and assets.

For example, consider the growth from 1970 to now; then, the average price of a home was $27,000.2 That same investment property today would fetch at least $500,000 based on the average housing-inflation rate since 1970—and possibly much more in some hotter-than-average real-estate markets.2 To put this into perspective, if a 25-year-old had made this investment in 1970, this now 55-year-old investment could potentially contribute to a relatively generous retirement nest egg if the property were sold.

While Google features are fairly polished, the same can’t be said of devices like the Motorola Edge 50 Pro. And given the irregular update schedule for Android devices, new AI features won’t appear with the regularity you’ll get with an iPhone.

It has been argued that a second, less obvious, advantage to raising the minimum wage is increased employee morale. Just as small businesses begin to bounce back from the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic, an increase in the federal minimum wage would significantly increase small businesses’ operating costs and make margins tighter. Raising the minimum wage to $15 also would increase childcare costs in the United States by an average of 21 percent. Therefore, a federally mandated $15 minimum wage would increase the cost of labor for childcare providers by almost 33 percent.

Cooper’s report also found that “the Raise the Wage Act would disproportionately help workers in poverty or near the poverty line” because “nearly half (46.7 percent) of all workers who would be affected by raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2024 have total family incomes within 200 percent of the poverty line,” demonstrating that raising the minimum wage would directly affect the working poor who have long been oppressed by stagnant wages.

Rao and Risch were able to examine revenue, employment, profits, and more following minimum wage increases in six states—thanks to panel data they built that match the universe of U.S. tax returns of independent businesses to the individual income tax returns of each of their workers and owners over a 10-year period. On the firm side, the average independent business in industries such as restaurants and retail is able to accommodate the minimum wage increases through higher revenues.

The financial obligations of owning a home don’t stop at the mortgage payment. * Property taxes (typically 1%–2% of the home's value annually). As a rule of thumb, assume 1%–2% of the home’s value every year. Those who can afford the down payment, mortgage, and subsequent costs, and who also have the patience and flexibility to endure the long time horizon often required, could potentially find a home purchase turning into a valuable asset. Despite the dramatic home price increases in recent years, it remains an effective long-term strategy for building wealth.",

Bankrate’s analysis of Realtor.com data found that in the priciest housing markets like Miami, Los Angeles and San Diego, fewer than one in 50 listings are affordable to the typical household. Nationally, over 75% of U.S. homes on the market are unaffordable to the typical household, and the typical American household needs to make at least $33,000 more annually to be able to afford a median-priced house. The typical household earns roughly $80,000 per year, while homebuyers need an income of at almost $113,000 afford a median-priced home in the U.S. Differences in affordability from region to region often trace back to whether new houses are being built.",

For as long as video game consoles have existed, there has been some sort of conflict between owners of rival systems across Atari, Nintendo, SEGA and for the last twenty years or so, Xbox, PlayStation and…still Nintendo. Previously, even if Microsoft was downplaying console sales, there was *at least* this narrative that they had scooped up all these studios to finally make attractive games to compete with Sony’s first party offerings. Sony did have a brilliant bit of success with the Helldivers 2 launch, but they cancelled Naughty Dog’s Last of Us multiplayer game which cost their prized studio years of work, and now Concord, which reportedly has been in development for eight years, is about to unavoidably tank when it’s released tomorrow. But Microsoft and Sony especially are both running into significant problems with their respective models, and even if PlayStation has outsold Xbox consoles for a decade now, it’s a bit more complicated than that.",

Most experts agree that Microsoft's offering makes the biggest impact on future console gaming. When those are revealed, Microsoft also outlines plans for a complicated digital licensing system that ties copies of games to a user's Xbox Live ID.

(I'm the most people he's talking about.)\n\nLayden's comments come at a time when console generations in particular are becoming less and less dramatic. The shift from 2D gaming to 3D gaming was, ahem, game-changing. The Xbox to Xbox 360 jump ushered in HD graphics and beefed up online play. The PS5 and Xbox Series X|S generation, by comparison, is only an incremental upgrade.\n\n\"I think we've plateaued on the tech, frankly,\" he said in an interview with gamesindusry.biz. \"How many of us can really tell the difference between 90 frames per second and 120 frames per second?\"\n547 comments\n",

As a result, the PC’s global share of the video game market in 2024 lands at $41.5 billion – so it won’t be long until the PC battleline overtakes the army of console players, right? The gap between the two consoles is widening, too; stats suggest that for every one Xbox Series X/S bought during November 2024, five PlayStation 5 consoles were also purchased (a ratio no doubt helped by the launch of the PS5 Pro.) Sony’s Game and Network Services also saw a healthy 12.3% bump in its profits during the final months of 2024, helped specifically by healthy first-party sales including Astro Bot selling 1.5 million copies in under two months, and lifetime sales for Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut surpassing 13 million.",

YSE Economists Kenneth Gillingham and Matthew Kotchen were part of a Yale team that analyzed the “Musk partisan effect” on the company’s U.S. sales. They, along with Jackson School of Global Affairs Dean James Levinsohn and School of Management Professor Barry Nalebuff, examined the impact of Musk's partisan actions on Tesla vehicle sales in the U.S. since October 2022. They found that not only would Tesla sales have been 67-83% higher without Musk’s partisan effect — equating to 1-1.26 million more vehicles sold — but Musk’s actions also boosted sales of other electric and hybrid vehicles by 17-22%. “The effect has been increasing over time, such that by the first quarter of 2025, we found that Tesla sales would have been about 125% higher than they were without the Musk partisan effect,” Kotchen said.",

For claims where Musk posted directly on X, I also collected publicly available engagement metrics—likes, replies, reposts, bookmarks, and views—and calculated both follower-based and view-based engagement rates (ER). To better understand the structure of Musk-related misinformation, I began with a hand-coded dataset of around 50 fact-checked claims from 2024. Some of the most viral claims from 2024 turned out to be true—or at least grounded in real posts by Musk. To move beyond anecdote, I selected five Musk-authored tweets from 2024 that were directly linked to false or controversial claims flagged by fact-checkers or widely covered in the media. One example is a *New York Post* story headlined “Elon Musk gloats as X fact-checks Biden tweet that ‘no one is above the law’ after Hunter pardon,” which generated significant traction across platforms, with a dominant Facebook reaction of laughter. #### **Appendix: Fact-Checked Claims Related to Elon Musk (2024)**.",

I take it from Branko’s letter that he means Greed I is good for the economy because being successful on competitive markets requires Greed I, and Greed I is morally acceptable because it follows logically from the conditions of capitalist competition. Despite Branko’s words, it would be hard to make the case that Greed II is good either morally or for the economy. It’s probably the most important way that socially responsible firms manage to overcome what would often be the serious cost disadvantages that make Professor Milanovic skeptical about there being a productive role for morality in the capitalist system.",

With the success of this project, Gates left Harvard during his junior year and, with Allen, formed Microsoft. Gates’s sway over the infant microcomputer industry greatly increased when Microsoft licensed an operating system called MS-DOS to International Business Machines Corporation—then the world’s biggest computer supplier and industry pacesetter—for use on its first microcomputer, the IBM PC (personal computer).

Microsoft’s BASIC software was popular with computer hobbyists, but according to Gates’ later account, only about 10 percent of the people using it had actually paid for it. As the computer industry grew with companies like Apple, Intel, and IBM developing hardware and components, Gates was continuously on the road touting the merits of Microsoft software applications, often taking his mother with him. That November, nearly two years after his announcement, Gates and Microsoft launched Windows. In 2006, Gates announced he was transitioning away from full-time work at Microsoft to devote more quality time to his philanthropic foundation.

Climate change is not going to wipe out humanity, he argued, and past efforts that strive for achieving zero carbon emissions have made real progress. But Gates said that past investments fighting climate change have been misplaced, and too much good money has been put into expensive and questionable efforts. Although Gates said investment to battle climate change must continue, he argued that President Donald Trump’s cuts to USAID threaten a more urgent problem, inflicting potentially lasting global damage to the fight against famine and life-threatening preventable sickness. “Although climate change will have serious consequences – particularly for people in the poorest countries – it will not lead to humanity’s demise,” Gates wrote.

Bill Gates’ leadership style is a blend of intellectual rigour, visionary thinking, competitive drive, and a deep commitment to societal betterment. The lasting impact of Bill Gates’ leadership is multifaceted, reflecting his influential roles in technology, philanthropy, and global health. At Microsoft, Gates’ visionary leadership revolutionised the personal computing landscape.

Mr. Douthat is an Opinion columnist and the host of the “Interesting Times” podcast. I tend to be pretty skeptical of this scenario: America has outlasted challengers before and China seems to me to have remarkable strengths, yes, but also serious weaknesses. Dan Wang is a keen observer of contemporary China, and his new book,” Breakneck: China’s Quest to Engineer the Future,” argues that the Trump administration’s current trade war is wrongheaded or too late, and that American pre-eminence can be preserved if we imitate the things that China is getting right. *Below is an edited transcript of an episode of “Interesting Times.” We recommend listening to it in its original form for the full effect.",

Republican support is much higher than it was in May 2020, when 56% favored more fracking. More broadly, majorities of Democrats oppose all forms of fossil fuel development we asked about in our recent survey, including offshore oil and gas drilling, hydraulic fracturing, and coal mining. While Republicans express broad support for fracking overall, there are notable differences of opinion within the GOP by age.

Also, with climate change creating increasing water shortages, nuclear power plants are at risk of temporary shut downs since without water they can’t be cooled. In addition to the significant risk of cancer associated with fallout from nuclear disasters, studies also show increased risk for those who reside near a nuclear power plant, especially for childhood cancers such as leukemia. The 440 nuclear power plants currently in existence provide about 9% of the world’s energy. Dr. Peter Bradford of Vermont Law, a former member of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, writes, \"A world more reliant on nuclear power would involve many plants in countries that have little experience with nuclear energy, no regulatory background in the field and some questionable records on quality control, safety and corruption.\" The U.S. should lead by example and encourage poor countries to invest in safe renewable energy technology.",

The time lag between planning and operation of a nuclear reactor includes the times to identify a site, obtain a site permit, purchase or lease the land, obtain a construction permit, obtain financing and insurance for construction, install transmission, negotiate a power purchase agreement, obtain permits, build the plant, connect it to transmission, and obtain a final operating license. The planning-to-operation (PTO) times of all nuclear plants ever built have been 10-19 years or more.

Europe’s first priority is to continue supporting Ukraine – Ukraine’s experienced military is currently the most effective deterrent against a Russian attack on the EU. While there are estimates that Ukraine would need around 150,000 European troops to effectively deter Russia6, these troops would need to be ready to be deployed rapidly to wherever Russia might decide to attack the EU. The current assumption of NATO military planners (RAND, 2024) is that in case of a Russian attack on a European NATO country, 100,000 US troops stationed in Europe would be rapidly augmented by up to 200,000 additional US troops, concentrated in US armoured units best suited for the East European battlefield. Military equipment spending is currently about 0.7 percent of GDP (Wolff *et al*, 2024); it would need to increase substantially.",

Just try having a great team and no product, or a great market and no product. In my experience, the most frequent case of great team paired with bad product and/or terrible market is the second- or third-time entrepreneur whose first company was a huge success. **Lots of startups fail before product/market fit ever happens.**.

Unfortunately, this level of dominance made Ford complacent – and it didn’t do much while G.M. worked tirelessly to expand its product line and offer more kinds of cars. This means that selling a novel kind of product or service requires the first-mover to make significant efforts on educating their target audience: ***why*** customers should want or need it, ***what*** problem it solves and ***how*** they should use it. The ultimate reason to avoid being a first-mover is that the Stanford Business School professors behind the original paper had a change of heart just 10 years later.",

Some management concepts have such intuitive appeal that their validity is almost taken for granted. First-mover advantage is one such concept. Although the fate of its most-convinced adherents, the dot-coms, offers a cautionary lesson, managers’ faith that first-mover status brings important competitive advantages, even when network effects are not available to accelerate and entrench it, remains undiminished. Business executives from every kind of company maintain, almost without exception, that early entry into a new industry or product category gives any firm an almost insuperable head start.

Overall, the BBB cuts taxes by $4.5 trillion over the next decade, primarily with $2.3 trillion of provisions that deliver most of their benefits to the richest 10 percent of Americans by income, according to new analysis of JCT data by the Center for American Progress. However, the BBB permanently enacted a two-tier system, established under the 2017 TCJA, that allows pass-through business owners access to special, lower marginal tax rates than workers. Provisions like the pass-through business deduction, the international business tax cuts, and miscellaneous tax cuts layer benefits on already profitable businesses; but provisions tied to increasing investments can have economically beneficial effects.",

        "content": "One revenue-raising policy proposal that has been discussed in recent years is a tax on wealth, which would impose a levy on assets owned by an individual or household. Advocates of a wealth tax argue that it would be an effective means of raising revenues while addressing wealth and income inequality and affecting only a tiny fraction of U.S. households. To illustrate the basic concept, consider a simple example of a 2 percent wealth tax imposed on all individual or household net worth above $100 million (the exemption threshold). ### A Wealth Tax Would Raise Revenues. Using those estimates, if a 1 percent wealth tax were imposed on all assets comprising that base and no evasion occurred, the tax would raise an additional $94 billion, or about 3 percent of total federal revenues in 2019; if enforcement were weak and base erosion were 50 percent, the amount of revenues raised would be half as large.",

A wealth tax would require taxpayers to pay at regular intervals on the appreciation of their assets, regardless of whether they have the cash or liquid assets to pay. Under her plan, high-wealth taxpayers would likely pay taxes on their capital gains each year as their assets appreciate in value. Even a very wealthy individual may not have the liquid assets to pay the tax on their changes in wealth. Under Harris’s proposal, taxpayers who don’t have cash to pay taxes may  have to borrow money or sell. *Nathan Goldman and Christina Lewellen are associate professors of accounting in the Poole College of Management.*",

At the end of 2022, the Spanish central government introduced a new, temporary “solidarity wealth tax” in 2022 and 2023 (to be collected in 2023 and 2024) ranging from 1.7 percent to 3.5 percent on individuals with net assets exceeding EUR 3 million (USD 3.23 million).

In the intervening decades, V.R. has thrived at two extremes in the quest for “killer apps.” It has long been an established industrial technology: if you’ve flown, ridden, or sailed in a factory-built vehicle in the last thirty years, virtual reality may have played a central role. Nonetheless, experiences will come from all kinds of companies, and V.R. could agitate and depress people even more than the little screens on smartphones.

This creates the uncertainty of not knowing which world is real or a simulation. I truly felt the advancement of this new technology when I used it. During my experience with the new Meta Quest 3, I was fully mesmerized by the new world I was within. For example, I almost fell over when I tried Richie’s Plank Experience.

If the companies building and operating the data centers (the main cost of AI) are spending less than they make, then everything is basically safe.

For the past year I have been working on a business idea that I strongly believe could be very profitable.

I would try to work for a smaller company where you can be closer to the business side of things. I worked as a consultant for a small company for 5 years and not only did I learn the business side, but also learned how to be a consultant, not just an IT guy.

In this post, I’ll share more about the limitations to working more hours and some of the things I’ve learned about maintaining balance in a startup from both an employee’s and founder’s perspective. **While it’s a myth that every startup requires you to work overtime every week, most startup employees put in 50-60 hours per week, and many founders put in 60-100 per week.**. So if the research is against long hours for most people, why do startup founders work so much? Here are four things I’ve learned about startup work hours and pacing as a founder:. While the bulk of an early-stage startup’s culture is defined by the founders, employees and managers have a lot of influence on working hours and pacing too.",

Intercontinental flights (on legacy carriers) typically include luggage for both North American airlines and those based elsewhere. The target demographics of legacy (or full-service or whatever name you prefer for non-LCC) carriers is different from that of low-cost carriers (LCCs.) LCCs target primarily infrequent leisure travelers who choose flights primarily based on lowest price, even if the flights are less convenient and less reliable. Interlining agreements between airlines, especially those within an alliance, also often include allowing passengers to through-check their bags across multiple carriers instead of needing to re-check at connections. Perhaps one of the biggest differences between legacy carriers and LCCs is that legacy carriers typically have extensive loyalty programs designed to entice their highest-profit customers to keep their flying within that airline and its partners rather than shopping around for the cheapest flight for each trip.",

Items like personal cubicles or designated workstations that seemed like a better fit for the \"private office\" argument will start making an appearance in these spaces as a way to keep employees safe and productive. Closed spaces or private offices have been observed to enhance concentration and possibly productivity by minimizing the distractions (noise, movement) that may naturally occur in open-space environments. While there can be significant savings in the successful implementation of a well-designed open-space work environment, unless you're creating a space that's specifically designed to fit your company's business, mission, and culture, the savings could be for nothing.

One of the key enablers of smart homes is the use of data and analytics to understand how occupants use their homes, and to optimize systems accordingly. The future of smart homes lies in a continued evolution of the ‘Artificial Intelligence of Things’ (AIoT), a move towards technology and infrastructure that learns and acts automatically, rather than requiring manual input.",

In order to ensure your data and work are safe, make sure the crowdsourcing partner you choose doesn't provide their members with access to real data sets.
