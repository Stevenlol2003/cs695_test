With my due respect to seinfeld NOTHING could be compared to FRIENDS. I Have been watching friends on Daily basis since 2014 , never skipped a day ,, it’s my bed time story ,, I know exactly what the next sentence is and it still cracks me up. Do you expect anyone to vote for Seinfeld on a Friend's page? I like both but I rewatch Friends more. Friends is more dear to me;can watch a lot over n over. Courteney was on a Seinfeld episode but Jason Alexander was on a Friends episode too. Friends, immediately entertaining and watch to this day.",

In August 1988, the first poetry slam held in New York City was hosted by Bob Holman at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe. Soon afterward, poetry slams increased in popularity, which allowed some poets to make full-time careers in performance and competition, touring the United States and eventually the world. * Javon Johnson \"Javon Johnson (poet)\") was national slam poetry champion in 2003 and 2004, wrote his dissertation on slam poetry and published an article in text and performance quarterly about black masculinity and sexism in the slam community.

The structures and requirements at poetry slams have shaped a certain style of poetry which tends to be successful within the slam context; it is work in this style which is generally termed ‘slam poetry.’ For instance, the requirement that poems performed at slams must be under three minutes has led to the creation of a style which values poems of this length.",

But the problem is that once you start to build an audience based on outrage and anger, as MSNBC and CNN are both doing in the age of Trump, you risk tumbling down a slippery slope, which is exactly what happened to Fox News. It’s alarming because in many ways Fox and MSNBC have walked right into Trump’s trap when he says the press is “the enemy of the people.” They’ve built up their audiences based on anger or support for Trump, and now they’re attached to it.",

Firstly I think if the laws give an opportunity for abortion to a woman in order to save a life then I see no point of changing them because this could result in just aborting carelessly which is also a health hazard more especially to women and I truly think that any unborn child has a right to life.",

Thomson maintains that whether a woman has a moral obligation to allow a fetus to remain in her body is a separate question from whether the fetus is a person with a right to life, and depends instead on the amount of sacrifice or burden it imposes on her. Instead of “repudiating a constitutional right we have not only previously recognized, but also expressly reaffirmed applying the doctrine of *stare decisis*“, the Court could simply have rejected viability as the point at which the state’s interest in protecting potential life outweighed the woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy, and upheld Mississippi’s right to ban abortions after 15 weeks.",

For one thing, says Quinn, it's important to maintain consistent funding for public health preparedness planning.

Following changes that placed increased focus on inattention, rather than hyperactivity, there was a correspondingly significant increase in ADHD diagnosis among females.34 Specifically, between 1991 and 2008, diagnosis rates increased by a factor of 5.6 in girls compared to only 3.7 in boys.35 In other words, knowing girls and underrepresented groups are more likely to have missed diagnoses, and even present with different symptoms, patients and clinicians might be asking more questions as a result.

Never having partaken in an ayahuasca retreat ceremony before, I desired a space that emphasized the safety of its participants and honoured the use of it through indigenous Amazonian healers and their way of working with the medicine. Facilitator Scott’s advice I now see transcends the ayahuasca retreats experience to life itself: enjoy the process. *Matthew Joseph seeks to inspire that desire for new experiences, like Ayahuasca Retreats*, *in his readers. Ayahuasca retreats are a form of spiritual or therapeutic tourism that involves participating in traditional shamanic ceremonies using a potent psychedelic brew called Ayahuasca.",

A 1995 study of Michigan oncologists revealed five factors that were important to physicians when considering the approval or disapproval of PAS: global attitudes toward PAS (including ideas like “Does a patient have a right to end his or her life if he or she has an incurable disease,” and “Oncologists should have the right to help a patient commit suicide by medical means”), attitudes toward the acceptability of withholding/withdrawing life-sustaining therapies, philosophical prohibitions toward PAS, concerns of legal consequences of PAS, and beliefs that PAS could be avoided with better end-of-life care [12]. When asked about current practices of PAS in states where it is legal, only 24% of physicians disagreed (49% agree; 26% neutral) that the most common reason for patients seeking PAS is physical pain (Table 4).",

In this manner, CBT differs from many other forms of psychological treatment. 2. Psychological problems are based, in part, on learned patterns of unhelpful behavior. 3. People suffering from psychological problems can learn better ways of coping with them, thereby relieving their symptoms and becoming more effective in their lives. CBT treatment usually involves efforts to change thinking patterns. CBT treatment also usually involves efforts to change behavioral patterns. Through exercises in the session as well as “homework” exercises outside of sessions, patients/clients are helped to develop coping skills, whereby they can learn to change their own thinking, problematic emotions, and behavior.",

If these people are right, cases in which torture might be morally justified by the same types of consideration that can justify killing in self-defense will be very rare. If, after taking into account the effect that engaging in torture might have on general respect for the law that for-bids it, a person still has good reason to believe that morality requires that he engage in torture, because the person to be tortured is clearly liable and the torture would be a necessary and proportionate means of defending the innocent, then I think that person ought morally to engage in torture.",

In a 5-country study on sex trafficking, most of the trafficked and prostituted women interviewed in the Philippines, Venezuela and the United States (3) strongly stated their opinion that prostitution should not be legalized and considered legitimate work, warning that legalization would create more risks and harm for women from already violent customer and pimps (Raymond et al, 2002).",

Not only does sex work become safer when it is regulated, but legalization also works to weed out the black market that exists for prostitution, thereby making women safer overall. The underlying reason that people are uncomfortable listening to sex workers about legalizing prostitution has nothing to do with concern for the health and safety of women. The underlying reason people disagree with legalizing prostitution is that prostitution is viewed as amoral because it involves (mostly) women selling their bodies for financial gain. What is disingenuous is opposing legalized sex work for reasons that purport to be women’s safety, but that are actually coming from a place of discomfort over women openly engaging in sexual interactions for financial gain.",

By contrast, numerous studies have shown that decriminalizing prostitution would bring the industry into the realm of law, redirect attention from prosecuting commercial sex to prosecuting the crimes that are the actual causes of the harm, which could prevent sex trafficking, violence, and other kinds of danger. Since the selling or buying of sex services is an action between two individuals with mutual consent, taking place in a private space and having no foreseeable impact on other parties, the state should not have the right to prohibit the action under criminal law, independent of morality. If prostitution is decriminalized and becomes taxable income, the extra government revenue could be used to provide health care benefits for sex workers to ensure their mental and physical health, fund programs to eliminate human trafficking, and set up departments for regulating and standardizing the industry.",

The Court meticulously detailed the history and tradition of the Second Amendment at the time of the Constitutional Convention and proclaimed that the Second Amendment established an individual right for U.S. citizens to possess firearms. Similarly, the Court in dicta stated that firearm regulations would not implicate the Second Amendment if that weaponry cannot be used for law-abiding purposes. *Kachalsky v County of Westchester*, 701 F.3d 81 (2nd Cir. 2012) (holding that a New York law preventing individuals from obtaining a license to possess a concealed firearm in public for general purposes unless the individual showed proper cause did not violate the Second Amendment).",

When animals are used for product toxicity testing or laboratory research, they are subjected to painful and frequently deadly experiments. However, many people believe that animal testing is justified because the animals are sacrificed to make products safer for human use and consumption. However, animal experimentation in medical research and cosmetics testing cannot be justified on the basis that animals are lower on the evolutionary chart than humans since animals resemble humans in so many ways. In conclusion, animal testing should be eliminated because it violates animals' rights, it causes pain and suffering to the experimental animals, and other means of testing product toxicity are available. Humans cannot justify making life better for themselves by randomly torturing and executing thousands of animals per year to perform laboratory experiments or to test products.",

Saunders, who was not involved in the report, agrees with its authors that scientific research supports using measures beyond BMI, including body composition and assessments of overall health. (It was supported by The Lancet, which forms commissions of academic experts to make recommendations on a topic.) The report’s central argument is that doctors should divvy people with obesity into two categories: those with “clinical obesity” whose weight is causing health problems or affecting day-to-day functioning, and those with “preclinical obesity,” who are otherwise healthy, based on blood tests and other assessments.",

However, due to the expense of these instruments and the time required for body fat assessments, obesity is clinically defined by measures that ‘estimate’ adiposity from body weight, body build and height. The body mass index (BMI) is another measure used to define overweight and obesity and is considered a more accurate estimate of body fatness than IBW. Weight gain causes a number of hormonal, metabolic and molecular changes in the body that increase the risk for even greater fat accumulation. Such obesity-associated biological changes reduce the body’s ability to oxidize (burn) fat for energy, increase the conversion of glucose (carbohydrate) to fat, and increase the body’s capacity to store fat in fat storage depots (adipose tissue). Weight gain, therefore, changes the biology of the body in a manner that favors further weight gain and obesity.",

Since Hollywood gets it wrong, and it’s actually very difficult to kill another human being, the general public is relatively unaware of reflex training — the training responsible for 90% of American soldiers firing at Vietnamese soldiers. There is no point to dehumanize, create distance, and tell others to see people as monsters if human beings are, in fact, naturally violent. But as Temple University psychologist Jeffrey Goldstein said, “when we don’t have wars, we call it the ‘interwar years.’ It’s a matter of selective reporting.” Or Kohn, yet again: “It is difficult to reconcile a theory of innate human aggressiveness with the simple fact that most people around us seem quite peaceful.”. The point of all this is that the nature of war requires conditioning people to fight for people they are trained to see as family.",

While Ronaldo is more of an executor, who plays high up the pitch and scores great goals when given the chance, Messi, who can do that just as well, is also comfortable dropping deep and keeping possession of the ball with his team. While Messi might have more talent, Ronaldo’s combination of physical and technical abilities just makes him better. Messi has an advantage over Ronaldo: Messi has won more titles mostly because he plays for a better team, not because he is a better player than Ronaldo. On one side, Messi is a better team player and simply more talented. Let us know you stand, Team Messi or Team Ronaldo?",

Providing teammates with key assists are a big part of James’s game, whereas Jordan was always seen as more of a selfish player. It took until 2019 for someone (James) to pass Jordan on the NBA’s all-time scoring records for most points scored on average during a season. Jordan won the NBA finals MVP award six times, compared to James’s four times.

In an August 2023 Forbes article contributor and Ohio State University journalism professor Nicole Kraft stated, “Nearly 70% of US adults said college athletes should be able to receive direct compensation from their school when asked in a recent survey.” Within the article, Sports Attorney Luke Fedlam, founder of Advance NIL added, “It’s about time.” This is referring to athletes being paid the money they deserve. There is such a worry about once amateur athletes get paid, the hype of college sports will be destroyed. No matter what sport(s) the athletes play, it’s very apparent that there is dedication and hard work in each of their performances.",

Although college athletes are now allowed to profit from NIL contracts, they still cannot receive pay-to-play salaries from their schools. Many college athletes receive sports scholarships, which are meant to be a form of compensation for their work. Next, take a look at the arguments in favor of paying college athletes for their work — with the emphasis on the word “work.” Collegiate sports do indeed represent a considerable commitment of time and effort, often resembling a full-time job. If few college athletes receive scholarships and fewer still receive full scholarships, and considering that playing college sports can be equivalent to a full-time job, then an argument could indeed be made that college athletes should receive salaries for their work.",

Defensive teams only appeared in three Super Bowls, their only win coming from a team led by Patrick Mahomes (and the two losses coming against his offenses). The only teams to win their conference that got worse on offense (outside of that strange 2021 Super Bowl) had such strong regular season performances that they simply couldn’t keep up the pace in the playoffs (‘18 LAR, ‘20 KC, ‘23 SF). If this were the case, though, it would be expected that the inverse is also true: offensive performance should degrade as well, assuming teams with better defenses make the playoffs. The fact of the matter is that defensive performance doesn’t matter as much as offense does in the playoffs; you can play worse than you did in the regular season, and still come away with conference and Super Bowl championships as long as your offense plays well.",

Both F1 and NASCAR aren’t just races; they set standards. A lot of them draw inspiration from either F1 or NASCAR, whether it’s the racing format, the car design, or the rules. Two races capture the essence of these motorsports: F1’s Monaco Grand Prix and NASCAR’s Daytona 500. Formula 1 (F1) and NASCAR are two titans of racing, and the vehicles they employ in their contests are as different as night and day.

The death penalty violates the right to life which happens to be the most basic of all human rights. Furthermore, the death penalty undermines human dignity which is inherent to every human being. **The death penalty does not deter crime effectively**. It is noteworthy that in many retentionist states, the effectiveness of the death penalty in order to prevent crime is being seriously questioned by a continuously increasing number of law enforcement professionals. Public support for the death penalty does not necessarily mean that taking away the life of a human being by the state is right. It needs to be pointed out that public support for the death penalty is inextricably linked to the desire of the people to be free from crime.

After dividing states into two groups, permanent disenfranchisement or voting rights restoration post-release, they found that individuals were approximately 10% less likely to recidivate if they were released in automatic restoration states versus permanent disenfranchisement states.17 Hamilton-Smith and Vogel posit that felony disenfranchisement creates community reintegration barriers for justice-impacted individuals which becomes an additional contributor to future criminality. In 2023, Minnesota and New Mexico restored the right to vote for over 57,000 justice-impacted persons who are on felony probation or parole.35 In 2020, Washington, DC, became the third jurisdiction in the continental United States where individuals incarcerated for a felony conviction can vote.36 While this is progress, felony disenfranchisement remains deeply entrenched in this country.",

Each year since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on January 1, 1994, officials in Canada, Mexico, and the United States have regularly declared the agreement to be an unqualified success. NAFTA, while extending protections for investors, explicitly excluded any protections for working people in the form of labor standards, worker rights, and the maintenance of social investments. These reports, based in part on more comprehensive labor market surveys in all three countries,1 show that the impact on workers in each nation has been different according to their circumstances. Contrary to what the American promoters of NAFTA promised U.S. workers, the agreement did not result in an increased trade surplus with Mexico, but the reverse. As Bruce Campbell of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives reports, Canada’s increased market integration with the United States began in 1989 with the bilateral Free Trade Agreement, the precursor to NAFTA.",

In a recent study that de-emphasized the impact of NAFTA on the U.S. economy, economists David Autor (MIT), David Dorn (University of Zurich) and Gordon Hanson (University of California, San Diego) stress the role of China’s emergence on job growth and wages in the U.S. In the study, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, they write: “China’s emergence as a great economic power has induced an epochal shift in patterns of world trade.",

A 2016 report by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence concluded that “the public narrative cultivated by Snowden and his allies is rife with falsehoods, exaggerations, and crucial omissions” and that “the vast majority of the documents he stole have nothing to do with programs impacting individual privacy interests - they pertain instead to military, defense, and intelligence programs of great interest to America’s adversaries.”. His defenders included journalist Glenn Greenwald, *The Guardian* reporter who first published documents provided by Snowden that detail the NSA PRISM program to monitor the phone calls and emails of US citizens. “I never imagined that I would live to see our courts condemn the NSA’s activities as unlawful,” Snowden tweeted after the 2020 ruling. According to a May 2013 criminal complaint, the American government charged Snowden under the Espionage Act of 1917 with theft of government property, unauthorized communication of national defense information, and willful communication of classified communications intelligence information to an unauthorized person.",

The initial Arab Spring was “like one giant Woodstock,” said Alaoui. “People might think that the region is stagnant, that we’ve simply gone back to the bad old days of Hosni Mubarak or other Arab autocrats who were exemplars of ossification and stagnation, but that masks a lot of change in the region currently happening,” said Tarek Masoud, Kennedy School Professor of Public Policy and the Sultan Qaboos bin Said of Oman Professor of International Relations. “The drivers of the change are not the photogenic, admirable, creative young people who brought us the Arab Spring,” he said. “My belief is that the Saudi government looked at these uprisings of young people across the region and said, ‘If we don’t change things, we are going to find that happening here, and we’re not going to be able to weather it,’” said Masoud.",

According to Rufus King, “It was with the people that the Constitution meant to place the election of the Chief Magistrate.” The Constitution’s Electoral College Clause (Article II, section 1, clause 3) stipulates that electors from each state shall elect the president. However, most states adopted popular election of presidential electors in the 1810s and 1820s. Abolishing the Electoral College, however, would change the structure of the presidency to make it easier for popularly elected presidents to concentrate power in the executive branch. But the fact remains that a majority of the Electoral College elect’s presidents, not a majority of all Americans.

He cites the example of the 2016 United States presidential election and the 2017 French presidential election, in which supporters of Bernie Sanders and Jean-Luc Mélenchon were alleged to have preferred or voted for Donald Trump and Marine Le Pen. In this sense, he argues that the horseshoe theory is used to engage in red-baiting or *reductio ad Hitlerum*, which allows them to \"discredit the left while disavowing their own complicity with the far right.\" Choat says that \"it is patently absurd to compare Stalin to present-day leftists like Mélenchon or Corbyn\", and concludes: \"If liberals genuinely want to understand and confront the rise of the far right, then rather than smearing the left they should perhaps reflect on their own faults.\".",

Professor Cleveland said that the administration has claimed that these groups have joined with Al-Qaeda in the fight against the United States and thus should be treated as “co-belligerents.” Professor Koh then turned the discussion to Daniel Cahen to focus on how force may be used — i.e., assuming one has resolved the various issues raised by Professor Cleveland and has concluded that the use of lethal force is lawful.",

Each year since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on January 1, 1994, officials in Canada, Mexico, and the United States have regularly declared the agreement to be an unqualified success. NAFTA, while extending protections for investors, explicitly excluded any protections for working people in the form of labor standards, worker rights, and the maintenance of social investments. These reports, based in part on more comprehensive labor market surveys in all three countries,1 show that the impact on workers in each nation has been different according to their circumstances. Contrary to what the American promoters of NAFTA promised U.S. workers, the agreement did not result in an increased trade surplus with Mexico, but the reverse. As Bruce Campbell of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives reports, Canada’s increased market integration with the United States began in 1989 with the bilateral Free Trade Agreement, the precursor to NAFTA.",

In a recent study that de-emphasized the impact of NAFTA on the U.S. economy, economists David Autor (MIT), David Dorn (University of Zurich) and Gordon Hanson (University of California, San Diego) stress the role of China’s emergence on job growth and wages in the U.S. In the study, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, they write: “China’s emergence as a great economic power has induced an epochal shift in patterns of world trade.",

If a $500,000 home appreciates, even a small percentage annually, the owner earns that return on the entire value of the house, not just the down payment. * Home value after 10 years = roughly $671,000. This dynamic lends credence to the view that buying a home is typically a long-term investment rather than a one- or two-year flip. The financial obligations of owning a home don’t stop at the mortgage payment. * Property taxes (typically 1%–2% of the home's value annually). As a rule of thumb, assume 1%–2% of the home’s value every year. Those who can afford the down payment, mortgage, and subsequent costs, and who also have the patience and flexibility to endure the long time horizon often required, could potentially find a home purchase turning into a valuable asset. Despite the dramatic home price increases in recent years, it remains an effective long-term strategy for building wealth.",

Republican support is much higher than it was in May 2020, when 56% favored more fracking. More broadly, majorities of Democrats oppose all forms of fossil fuel development we asked about in our recent survey, including offshore oil and gas drilling, hydraulic fracturing, and coal mining.

Advocates of a wealth tax argue that it would be an effective means of raising revenues while addressing wealth and income inequality and affecting only a tiny fraction of U.S. households. To illustrate the basic concept, consider a simple example of a 2 percent wealth tax imposed on all individual or household net worth above $100 million (the exemption threshold). ### A Wealth Tax Would Raise Revenues. Using those estimates, if a 1 percent wealth tax were imposed on all assets comprising that base and no evasion occurred, the tax would raise an additional $94 billion, or about 3 percent of total federal revenues in 2019; if enforcement were weak and base erosion were 50 percent, the amount of revenues raised would be half as large.",

The target demographics of legacy (or full-service or whatever name you prefer for non-LCC) carriers is different from that of low-cost carriers (LCCs.) LCCs target primarily infrequent leisure travelers who choose flights primarily based on lowest price, even if the flights are less convenient and less reliable. Interlining agreements between airlines, especially those within an alliance, also often include allowing passengers to through-check their bags across multiple carriers instead of needing to re-check at connections. Perhaps one of the biggest differences between legacy carriers and LCCs is that legacy carriers typically have extensive loyalty programs designed to entice their highest-profit customers to keep their flying within that airline and its partners rather than shopping around for the cheapest flight for each trip.",
