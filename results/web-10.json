In the new book by journalist and author Amy Odell, Paltrow is described as \"one of the most resented celebrities in the world\". \"Women's ambition is not always viewed positively, and I wondered if that's why Gwyneth downplayed her ambition early in her career,\" says Odell. \"With Gwyneth, we see her ambition in the breadth of Goop – she wanted Goop to do everything, and to execute it all perfectly. One of the focal points of Odell's book is the close father-daughter relationship between Bruce and Gwyneth.

Pozner notes In her influential 2010 book *Reality Bites Back: The Troubling Truth About Guilty Pleasure TV*, reality programming “has the power to influence our notions of normalcy versus difference, convince us that certain behaviors are ‘innate’ for different groups of people, and present culturally constructed norms of gender, race, class, and sexuality as ‘natural,’” rather than as a reaction to external circumstances.

Any moral obligation to pay for something that can be gotten for free without stealing it is a separate debate from piracy. # Piracy is not morally wrong. As piracy does not take anything from creators, and is not stealing, I say that piracy is not morally wrong, despite not giving anything to those creators for compensation.

But while film studios raced to combat the last few years of instability in the entertainment industry, this data analysis shows that opportunities for people of color fell across the board after recent gains, while women also saw a drop as writers, even as their share of lead roles increased. Even as the domestic and global box offices responded positively to diverse films, Hollywood’s progress slid in terms of race, ethnicity and disability, while women posted gains in a few categories. Another look at investment found that like 2023, white women directors were more likely than white men or people of color to helm films with lower budgets; 45.5% of their films had budgets less than $20 million.",

I’m surprised it did as well as it did, because “Gladiator II” had more than the usual number of problems: 1) The protagonist of the original film was dead, so the movie needed a new leading man; 2) The premise, without going into detail, was absurd; and, most importantly, 3) Paul Mescal didn’t seem like a tough guy. **Hello, Mick:** I have recently watched two productions of “Cape Fear.”  The first starring Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum, the second starring Nick Nolte and Robert De Niro. **Hello, Warren:**Mitchum was great in the original “Cape Fear” (1962), but Martin Scorsese’s 1991 remake starring Robert De Niro is the better movie. 3) Often, the more companies involved, the better the movie.",

Studying literature develops practical, transferable skills valued across careers. ## Why Do We Study Literature? **Get more information about studying literature at Gustavus Adolphus**. Studying the literary traditions of different cultures around the world provides you with a deeper understanding of what a culture's literature says about its people's values and world views. ### Exploring the Connection Between Creative Writing and Studying Literature. Studying literature provides inspiration and examples for the creative writer. ## Why Our Students are Studying Literature. Students from all backgrounds find that their literature studies open their minds to unique perspectives and give them real-world skills — useful no matter what their major may be. In my case, having the opportunity to study literature in two different languages has helped me to find similarities in two different cultures, and to also find that although literature varies in form and content, it is important and it is a central part of many lives.\".",

Recent research in cognitive science, psychology and neuroscience has demonstrated that deep reading — slow, immersive, rich in sensory detail and emotional and moral complexity — is a distinctive experience, different in kind from the mere decoding of words. The study also found that young people who read daily only onscreen were nearly two times less likely to be above-average readers than those who read daily in print or both in print and onscreen.",

Put yourself out there, and people will actually feel you are famous and begin to know you are famous.” Yes, I can actually try to feel it, like I can at that moment be in a tongue in cheek channeling moment, it but in reality, I disagree, because I can’t really channel it on a daily basis mostly because I am not feeling the fame like she is trying to get me to do.

Owing to slam poetry’s origins as a popular rather than a literary form, poets who work in the format strive to use simple, straightforward language to communicate emotionally impactful, relevant messages that resonate with everyday listeners.

The structures and requirements at poetry slams have shaped a certain style of poetry which tends to be successful within the slam context; it is work in this style which is generally termed ‘slam poetry.’ For instance, the requirement that poems performed at slams must be under three minutes has led to the creation of a style which values poems of this length.",

This helps schools benchmark their students' educational outcomes against a broad sample used during the standardization process. 5. With a consistent measure of student achievement, standardized exams allow for meaningful district comparisons and help maintain educational standards nationwide. Standardized tests have been a staple in U.S. education since the mid-1800s, providing a consistent way to measure student achievement. Here’s what standardized testing can do:. By having all learners take the same standardized assessment — regardless of their school or district — school leaders can easily compare student test scores across diverse backgrounds. Standardized tests can highlight achievement gaps between student groups, like those from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Savvy students can often guess answers on standardized tests based on familiar patterns or questions they already know. Standardized tests can undermine the confidence of previously successful students. Nevertheless, these tests help educators pinpoint learning gaps by comparing student knowledge.",

For older children and adults, it's a good idea to go for lower-fat milks because having too much saturated fat in your diet can lead to high cholesterol. Milk and dairy products are an important part of a young child's diet. But babies who are around 6 months old can eat foods that use full-fat cows' milk as an ingredient, such as cheese sauce and custard. Children over 1 year old can also be given pasteurised semi-skimmed milk as a drink, as long as they're eating a varied and balanced diet and growing well. Full-fat dairy products, such as cheese, fromage frais and yoghurt, are recommended up to the age of 2 years. Some other dairy products are made with unpasteurised milk, including some cheeses.",

Instead of “repudiating a constitutional right we have not only previously recognized, but also expressly reaffirmed applying the doctrine of *stare decisis*“, the Court could simply have rejected viability as the point at which the state’s interest in protecting potential life outweighed the woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy, and upheld Mississippi’s right to ban abortions after 15 weeks.",

In recognizing the right to abortion, *Roe* was consistent with earlier Supreme Court rulings recognizing a right of privacy that protects intimate and personal decisions—including those affecting child-rearing, marriage, procreation, and the use of contraception—from governmental interference. On January 22, 1973, the Supreme Court struck down Texas’s criminal ban on abortion and held that the right to abortion is a “fundamental right.”1In the 7–2 opinion, the Court held that, along with decisions relating to marriage, contraception, education, and family relationships, the decision about whether to continue or end a pregnancy is fundamental to “personal liberty.”2 In doing so, the Court recognized the great “detriment that the State would impose upon the pregnant woman by denying this choice,” including the health and economic risks of being forced to continue a pregnancy.3.",

Following changes that placed increased focus on inattention, rather than hyperactivity, there was a correspondingly significant increase in ADHD diagnosis among females.34 Specifically, between 1991 and 2008, diagnosis rates increased by a factor of 5.6 in girls compared to only 3.7 in boys.35 In other words, knowing girls and underrepresented groups are more likely to have missed diagnoses, and even present with different symptoms, patients and clinicians might be asking more questions as a result.

Maria Montessori began developing her educational philosophy and methods in 1897, attending courses in pedagogy at the University of Rome and learning educational theory.: 60 While visiting Rome's mental asylums during her schooling with a teacher, Montessori observed that confined children were in need of more stimulation from their environment. Montessori continued to extend her work during her lifetime, developing a comprehensive model of psychological development from birth to age 24, as well as educational approaches for children ages 0 to 3, 3 to 6, and 6 to 12. Montessori education involves free activity within a \"prepared environment\", meaning an educational environment tailored to basic human characteristics, to the specific characteristics of children at different ages, and to the individual personalities of each child. Montessori education for this level is less developed than programs for younger children. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Lillard, Angeline S (2013), \"Playful Learning and Montessori Education\" (PDF), *American Journal of Play*, vol.

The result is that to fill the power gap, utilities employing solar and wind farms still need to keep their fossil-fueled generators running to provide power when the sun isn’t shining or the wind not blowing. In short, and as much as I wanted it to be otherwise, when it comes to replacing reliable, weather-independent, 24/7 coal or gas plants, the intermittency of solar and wind farms simply doesn’t fill the need. If we really want to mitigate climate change, it’s time to put to work technologies whose physics and math say they *actually* *can* supply the massive baseload power to replace those fossil plants and meet the new demand. If the United States is to meet the anticipated doubling of electricity demand *and* its climate goals, the American people must demand that their leaders include a significant buildout of new nuclear power.",

Interestingly, the *why* of Ayahuasca use seemed to play a role in the kind and severity of mental health side effects: People whose cultural or spiritual practices involved Ayahuasca use had notably fewer negative experiences than people who used it in an uncontrolled or recreational context. That risk is higher for people using Ayahuasca in concert with other substances and for individuals experiencing depression, anxiety, psychosis, mania and related mental health symptoms. If you’re familiar with Ayahuasca, you may have heard that researchers think it has the potential to help with a wide range of mental health conditions, like substance-use disorder (SUD), substance withdrawal, eating disorders, treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).",

These Indigenous shamans are framed as holders of natural wisdom and ancient techniques of plant-spirit healing, which helps explain why international tourists, primarily from Western societies, keep coming to the Amazon rainforest in search of ‘authentic’ ayahuasca experiences. This retreat drew people from around the world who had come to drink ayahuasca with a family of Shipibo healers led by Maestra Rosa Pinedo Vasquez – affectionately known to guests as Mama Rosa. Many global ayahuasca retreats in Peru appear to minimise interactions between guests and Indigenous healers, most likely because healers are steeped in beliefs and contexts that clash with the key marketing efforts that target international guests.",

A 1995 study of Michigan oncologists revealed five factors that were important to physicians when considering the approval or disapproval of PAS: global attitudes toward PAS (including ideas like “Does a patient have a right to end his or her life if he or she has an incurable disease,” and “Oncologists should have the right to help a patient commit suicide by medical means”), attitudes toward the acceptability of withholding/withdrawing life-sustaining therapies, philosophical prohibitions toward PAS, concerns of legal consequences of PAS, and beliefs that PAS could be avoided with better end-of-life care [12]. When asked about current practices of PAS in states where it is legal, only 24% of physicians disagreed (49% agree; 26% neutral) that the most common reason for patients seeking PAS is physical pain (Table 4).",

Homework is a powerful tool to help narrow these inequities, giving children from all backgrounds the opportunity to keep learning when they are not in school. At this point, some teachers may be saying, “I can’t get my kids to hand in a worksheet, let alone rely on them to learn on their own.” And of course, effective use of homework in class relies on creating a strong system of accountability for getting kids to do it. This should include a schoolwide grading policy—at Success schools, missing and incomplete homework assignments receive a zero; students can get partial credit for work handed in late; and middle and high schoolers can revise their homework for a better grade—as well as consistently and explicitly noticing when kids are or are not prepared and offering praise and consequences.",

One of the most well-researched and efficacious treatments for anxiety disorders is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Some combination of cognitive restructuring and behavioral experiments are often implemented in CBT across all anxiety disorders. CBT can be used as a stand-alone treatment, may be combined with standard medications for the treatment of patients with anxiety disorders (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), or used with novel interventions (e.g., mindfulness).

Auditing is one of the core practices for new and experienced scientology members alike. At the time of the writing of Dianetics and the founding of Scientology, many Americans were interested in new religious experiences. Scientology is a secretive religion and does not advertise some of its core beliefs to outsiders. Experts on the religion say that church officials avoid discussing some of these beliefs with new members and it is not until they have been part of the church for a long time that they learn some of the more mystical beliefs. At the time he founded scientology, he was writing in Hollywood, hoping to further his entertainment career by penning screenplays. Many notable people did in fact join the church and go on to publicly advocate for Scientology.

If these people are right, cases in which torture might be morally justified by the same types of consideration that can justify killing in self-defense will be very rare. If, after taking into account the effect that engaging in torture might have on general respect for the law that for-bids it, a person still has good reason to believe that morality requires that he engage in torture, because the person to be tortured is clearly liable and the torture would be a necessary and proportionate means of defending the innocent, then I think that person ought morally to engage in torture.",

But many states have failed to criminalize torture as a specific offence under their national laws, and governments around the world continue to defy international law by torturing people. For more than 50 years Amnesty International has been documenting torture, exposing the perpetrators and helping victims get justice. In 2006, years of campaigning by Amnesty International and the Omega Research Foundation led to the EU adopting the world’s first legally binding regulation for controlling the trade in the ‘tools of torture’. ## Why do governments torture? In Cameroon for example, Amnesty has documented how the security forces have set up secret torture chambers for people accused, often with zero evidence, of being members of the armed group Boko Haram.

The current study addresses these limitations through a person-centered approach: trajectories of birth family contact incorporating three features of contact (frequency of contact, satisfaction with contact, and participation in cross-network contact) across four time points (middle childhood, adolescence, emerging adulthood, and young adulthood) were used in examining the relation between contact and outcomes in a sample of young adults who were domestically adopted in infancy.

In a 5-country study on sex trafficking, most of the trafficked and prostituted women interviewed in the Philippines, Venezuela and the United States (3) strongly stated their opinion that prostitution should not be legalized and considered legitimate work, warning that legalization would create more risks and harm for women from already violent customer and pimps (Raymond et al, 2002).",

Not only does sex work become safer when it is regulated, but legalization also works to weed out the black market that exists for prostitution, thereby making women safer overall. The underlying reason that people are uncomfortable listening to sex workers about legalizing prostitution has nothing to do with concern for the health and safety of women. The underlying reason people disagree with legalizing prostitution is that prostitution is viewed as amoral because it involves (mostly) women selling their bodies for financial gain. What is disingenuous is opposing legalized sex work for reasons that purport to be women’s safety, but that are actually coming from a place of discomfort over women openly engaging in sexual interactions for financial gain.",

By contrast, numerous studies have shown that decriminalizing prostitution would bring the industry into the realm of law, redirect attention from prosecuting commercial sex to prosecuting the crimes that are the actual causes of the harm, which could prevent sex trafficking, violence, and other kinds of danger. Since the selling or buying of sex services is an action between two individuals with mutual consent, taking place in a private space and having no foreseeable impact on other parties, the state should not have the right to prohibit the action under criminal law, independent of morality. If prostitution is decriminalized and becomes taxable income, the extra government revenue could be used to provide health care benefits for sex workers to ensure their mental and physical health, fund programs to eliminate human trafficking, and set up departments for regulating and standardizing the industry.",

Gun control laws only affect law-abiding people who go through legal avenues to obtain firearms.**. In fact, cities with some of the most stringent gun laws, like New York and Chicago, suffer from some of the highest violent crime rates. **The simplest solution is crime control — enforcing existing laws aimed at criminals who carry and use firearms to commit their crimes.**. Faced with a sky-high homicide rate, Richmond prosecutors began enforcing existing gun laws to the fullest, imposing lengthy sentences against drug dealers and other criminals who were carrying firearms illegally. In short, \"Project Exile\" demonstrated beyond a doubt that focusing on gun criminals, not placing undue burden on law-abiding citizens, is the best way to curb violent crime and make the American people safe.",

On March 14, 2023, President Joe Biden issued an executive order: “Executive Order on Reducing Gun Violence and Making Our Communities Safer.” Among other actions, the order directed U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland “to ensure that licensed gun dealers are aware and conduct the required background checks before purchases” in compliance with the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (signed into law in June 2022).",

McAllister-Williams states that the magnitude of therapeutic difference is the difference between drug and placebo, not absolute response to active drug and thus Kirsch’s study in fact supports the idea that antidepressants efficacy increases with depression severity [McAllister-Williams, 2008]. Huge variation at the patient level in antidepressant response is overlooked; indeed a patient-level meta-analysis found the magnitude of benefit of antidepressant treatment compared with placebo increased with the severity of depression [Fournier *et al.* 2010]. A more recent meta-analysis [Gibbons *et al.* 2012] re-analysing these data sets failed to show an increase in suicide risk in young people on either venlafaxine or fluoxetine, although they showed therapeutic benefit in the treatment of their depression; in working age and older adults there was a decrease in suicidal thoughts and behaviour that was mediated by treatment of depression.

Homework teaches students various beneficial skills that they will carry with them throughout their academic and professional life, from time management and organization to self-motivation and autonomous learning. Homework helps students of all ages build critical study abilities that help them throughout their academic careers. Homework is most effective when it allows students to revise what they learn in class. Homework also helps students develop key skills that they’ll use throughout their lives:. The skills learned in homework can then be applied to other subjects and practical situations in students’ daily lives. Homework helps parents track what their children are learning in school. According to a study, homework in primary schools has a minimal effect since students pursue unrelated assignments instead of solidifying what they have already learned. There are many pros and cons of homework, so let our tutors at Oxford Learning can help your family create great homework habits to ensure students are successful at homework.",

The researchers used survey data to examine perceptions about homework, student well-being and behavioral engagement in a sample of 4,317 students from 10 high-performing high schools in upper-middle-class California communities. **\\* Less time for friends, family and extracurricular pursuits:** Both the survey data and student responses indicate that spending too much time on homework meant that students were “not meeting their developmental needs or cultivating other critical life skills,” according to the researchers.

The case for cash rather than paid leave can be especially compelling for low-income families, who often struggle to meet basic needs while also having the least access to paid parental leave programs through their employers, and for households with stay-at-home parents, who may not directly benefit from work-based supports. In 2024, the Convergence Collaborative on Supports for Working Families introduced a bipartisan proposal for paid parental leave consisting of a stand-alone 12-week leave policy funded at the federal level with adequate wage replacement based on a social insurance model.",

Building on the work of Ruhm, Tanaka [6] published a study in 2005 that aimed to estimate the health effects of parental leave while also including the United States in the dataset, incorporating data more recent than 1994, and including more robust controls for other health measures (such as low birthweight) and separate social policies [6]. Tanaka also notes the logic of the non-linear results (that additional leave seems to accrue benefits to later child health) but points out that there is a statistically significant reduction for all infant mortality categories [6], and acknowledges that it is possible that the more leave that is available to expectant mothers, the more likely they are to use some of it before birth.",

This paper employs the insights of French sociologist, Pierre Bourdieu, to explore the persistence of animal research within academia. Several of Bourdieu’s concepts are applied, including field and habitus, but perhaps it is his concept of capital that is most valuable in this context, providing a valuable shorthand for discussing the system of rewards and penalties within academia, clarifying how animal research converts into symbolic as well as social and economic capital and elucidating what scientists risk if they attempt to transition from animal research to NAMs. Bourdieu reminds us to attend to power relationships, particularly the relationship between the animal research field and the field of power.",

Saunders, who was not involved in the report, agrees with its authors that scientific research supports using measures beyond BMI, including body composition and assessments of overall health. (It was supported by The Lancet, which forms commissions of academic experts to make recommendations on a topic.) The report’s central argument is that doctors should divvy people with obesity into two categories: those with “clinical obesity” whose weight is causing health problems or affecting day-to-day functioning, and those with “preclinical obesity,” who are otherwise healthy, based on blood tests and other assessments.",

However, due to the expense of these instruments and the time required for body fat assessments, obesity is clinically defined by measures that ‘estimate’ adiposity from body weight, body build and height. The body mass index (BMI) is another measure used to define overweight and obesity and is considered a more accurate estimate of body fatness than IBW. Weight gain causes a number of hormonal, metabolic and molecular changes in the body that increase the risk for even greater fat accumulation. Such obesity-associated biological changes reduce the body’s ability to oxidize (burn) fat for energy, increase the conversion of glucose (carbohydrate) to fat, and increase the body’s capacity to store fat in fat storage depots (adipose tissue). Weight gain, therefore, changes the biology of the body in a manner that favors further weight gain and obesity.",

NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (formerly known as the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope, and scheduled to launch no later than May 2027), could zero in on a distant planet’s reflected light to detect the signatures of oxygen, water vapor, or some other powerful indication of possible life.

This recognition of the role played by care for others is also present in many religious traditions – particularly in the ways that they address life’s sufferings. In both cases, care binds a good society together, in ways that sustain social hope.

Here, I place human sibling proportions in mammalian perspective by comparing data from a global sample of 103 human populations (*n* = 197 658 sibling dyads in total) and compare this with a dataset of 34 non-human mammal species (*n* = 61 163 sibling dyads). Although the variation in sibling composition across the human dataset is demonstrative of the obvious fact that humans are not universally monogamous, the finding that human rates of full siblings overlap with the range seen in socially monogamous mammal species and are consistently higher than those observed in non-monogamously mating mammal species lends weight to the broad-stroke characterization of monogamy as the modal mating pattern for our species.",

Since Hollywood gets it wrong, and it’s actually very difficult to kill another human being, the general public is relatively unaware of reflex training — the training responsible for 90% of American soldiers firing at Vietnamese soldiers. There is no point to dehumanize, create distance, and tell others to see people as monsters if human beings are, in fact, naturally violent. But as Temple University psychologist Jeffrey Goldstein said, “when we don’t have wars, we call it the ‘interwar years.’ It’s a matter of selective reporting.” Or Kohn, yet again: “It is difficult to reconcile a theory of innate human aggressiveness with the simple fact that most people around us seem quite peaceful.”. The point of all this is that the nature of war requires conditioning people to fight for people they are trained to see as family.",

Affirmative action is a relatively recent tool for most countries, with policies gaining momentum from the 1990s onwards, particularly in politics. Affirmative action policies can include “soft” measures designed to increase minority representation in a candidate pool. Positive discrimination, such as hiring a less-qualified candidate because she is from an underrepresented group, is prohibited under the Equality Act. India is known as the first country to adopt affirmative action policies. With colleagues, we built a global dataset of affirmative action policies around the world. In over half of the countries we studied, national protests and civic action emerged in support of or against the conduct of affirmative action policies. This suggests that the way forward may be to pursue soft over hard affirmative action measures — encouraging diversity without implementing quotas. \"Affirmative Action Policies to Increase Diversity Are Successful, but Controversial, Around the World,\" United Nations University, UNU Centre, UNU-WIDER, 2024-02-28, https://unu.edu/article/affirmative-action-policies-increase-diversity-are-successful-controversial-around-world.",

When University officials boast of \"looking for racism everywhere,\" as multicultural educator Greg Ricks did in a 1990 *Stanford Daily* interview, then perhaps the most sensible (and certainly the most predictable) response will be for white students to avoid dealing with such quarrelsome people. Certainly, no one has accused Stanford's admissions officers of being racist, so perhaps the real problem with affirmative action is that we are pretending to solve a problem that no longer exists.

Ice-T said about Minaj's rapping style, \"[Minaj] does her thing. Also combining rap with synthesizer music, Minaj's second album had a number of electro-hop and electropop songs: \"HOV Lane\", \"Whip It\", \"Automatic\", \"Come on a Cone\", \"Young Forever\", \"Fire Burns\", \"Roman Holiday\" and \"Beez in the Trap\"; while \"Starships\" is a eurodance song.[201] She collaborated with other artists, producing more electronic songs: \"The Boys\" with \"Me & U\" singer Cassie and \"Beauty and a Beat\" with Justin Bieber. Minaj cites Foxy Brown and Jay-Z as major influences: \"I really loved [Foxy] as a female rapper.",

When integrating phone time into the classroom environment, it serves to teach students digital boundaries and enforces a positive screen time limit that will follow students off campus. Managing student behavior through the creation of this boundary for situational cell phone use helps establish designated phone use on campus, encouraging students to live a life where their phone is a tool they are not dependent on. One proven fact is that cell phones in school can help accelerate a student’s learning. Lastly, you should allow phones at middle and high school campuses because this allows students to document and build their memories and relationships as they grow and create a positive school life where they feel happy to attend every day.",

Some proactive arguments for cellphone use include accelerated learning, access to digital content, and a communication tool to parents for student safety. Science teachers, business education teachers, and students who are interested in information technology (IT) may find researching the inner components of a cell phone interesting. Learning what’s inside of a cell phone can be a way for students to learn about the technology they use every day, and how it can be beneficial for communication and networking. This includes choosing specific educational content for students, designating device-free time in classrooms and at home, and modeling proper expectations and behavior for phone use. Managing cell phones in schools should be a priority to protect the learning environment for students. However, poor classroom management and a lack of specific rules and routines for cellphone use can be disastrous to student learning outcomes.",

She explains the difference across genders by referring to time use studies – in Norway, girls use their phones much more, so there is more scope for the ban to have an effect. We don’t have control over people’s lives all of the time – we can hardly ban some kids from accessing phones for their entire childhood. That the effects of screens appears to be mediated through time use is born out from studies of television when it rolled out. When we ban phones and laptops from the classroom, we get better performance. The mechanism seems to be through time use – studies of phone and television usage outside of school come to similar conclusions.",

Michael Rich, an associate professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and an associate professor of social and behavioral sciences at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, says that phones and school don’t mix: Students can’t meaningfully absorb information while also texting, scrolling, or watching YouTube videos. Pereira’s approach is to step back — and to ask whether a student who can’t resist the phone is a signal that the teacher needs to work harder on making a connection. “Two things I try to share with my new teachers are, one, why is that student on the phone? Mesfin Awoke Bekalu, a research scientist in the Lee Kum Sheung Center for Health and Happiness at the Chan School, argues that more flexible classroom policies can create opportunities for teaching tech-literacy and self-regulation.",

Schools must carefully weigh the pros and cons when deciding how to handle cellphone use during the school day. ### Pros of cellphone use. One of the biggest benefits of cellphones is their ability to give students access to educational resources. ### Cons of cellphone use. Some students use their phones to cheat on tests or plagiarize work, which can go against school policies and harm their own learning. Schools may face legal risks if students misuse their phones or if privacy issues arise due to phone use in the classroom. Cellphones can be useful tools in schools, but they also bring risks. Schools need to find a balance, allowing students to use their phones in helpful ways while keeping distractions and problems under control.",

Student use of cell phones during an unfolding emergency can distract their attention from safety and emergency response directions being given by school staff. Therefore the use of cell phones by students and others in the immediate school community could potentially decrease, not increase, school safety during a crisis. Cell phone use, texting, and other outside communications by students during a crisis also expedites parental flocking to the school at a time when school and public safety officials may need parents to be away from the school site due to evacuations, emergency response, and/or other tactical or safety reasons.",

Providing teammates with key assists are a big part of James’s game, whereas Jordan was always seen as more of a selfish player. It took until 2019 for someone (James) to pass Jordan on the NBA’s all-time scoring records for most points scored on average during a season.

Opponents of instant replay like former FIFA President Sepp Blatter argue that refereeing mistakes add to the \"fascination and popularity of football.\" It has been proposed that instant replay be limited to use in penalty incidents, fouls which lead to bookings or red cards and whether the ball has crossed the goal line, since those events are more likely than others to be game-changing.

In the proposed 1985 system, a replay official would have monitored the game feed from an in-stadium booth and initiated all reviews, reversing a call only with “indisputable visual evidence.”. Instant replay’s first regular season saw an average of 1.6 reviews per game. “My buddy, the instant replay guy,” Williams jokingly said after the game. Instant replay review was back in the NFL. Instant replay is an accepted part of the game,” said Atlanta Falcons general manager and Competition Committee Co-Chairman Rich McKay.

For instance, during each season of any professional sport, there are away games that keep players from their families. The rising gap between the average American’s income and a professional athlete’s income might pose a serious threat to sports. Professional athletes competing for money rather than for excellence will take the soul and magic out of sports, ruining it in the long run – for athletes and for fans. This trend holds a significant effect on players’ salaries: It helps some athletes get oversized contracts (what do Patrick Mahomes’ teammates think about his 2020 $503M contract?) while increasing income inequality between the majority of athletes. **The Bottom Line:** While it seems like there’s no way to stop such inflated salaries of professional athletes, the repercussions could cause long-term damage to professional sports.",

After a 2-page summary of Wenger’s statistics as a player (1969-1981), we get the league records and standings for each team Wenger managed, from his first season at Nancy (1984) to his last at Arsenal (2018), a summary of his accomplishments at Arsenal, a list of every player who appeared for Arsenal during Wenger’s tenure, and a list of the top ten transfer fees paid by Arsenal during his time. In some ways, *Wenger: My Life and Lessons in Red and White*is written particularly with Arsenal fans in mind, assuming they can fill in gaps in the narrative from memory while Wenger tries to mollify their disappointment at the club maintaining a top-four level without ever claiming a league championship during his last fourteen years managing Arsenal FC.",

Although college athletes are now allowed to profit from NIL contracts, they still cannot receive pay-to-play salaries from their schools. Many college athletes receive sports scholarships, which are meant to be a form of compensation for their work. Next, take a look at the arguments in favor of paying college athletes for their work — with the emphasis on the word “work.” Collegiate sports do indeed represent a considerable commitment of time and effort, often resembling a full-time job. If few college athletes receive scholarships and fewer still receive full scholarships, and considering that playing college sports can be equivalent to a full-time job, then an argument could indeed be made that college athletes should receive salaries for their work.",

In 1964, at the age of 22, Clay faced Sonny Liston for the heavyweight title. Soon after his victory, Clay announced he had joined the Nation of Islam and changed his name to Muhammad Ali. The name change marked the beginning of a new chapter in his life, not just as a boxer, but as a political and religious figure. Ali’s comeback included some of the most legendary bouts in boxing history. It was one of the greatest upsets in boxing history and marked Ali’s return to the top of the sport. Ali won when Frazier’s corner stopped the fight after the 14th round. Ali’s last fight was in December 1981, when he was 39 years old.

Defensive teams only appeared in three Super Bowls, their only win coming from a team led by Patrick Mahomes (and the two losses coming against his offenses). The only teams to win their conference that got worse on offense (outside of that strange 2021 Super Bowl) had such strong regular season performances that they simply couldn’t keep up the pace in the playoffs (‘18 LAR, ‘20 KC, ‘23 SF). If this were the case, though, it would be expected that the inverse is also true: offensive performance should degrade as well, assuming teams with better defenses make the playoffs. The fact of the matter is that defensive performance doesn’t matter as much as offense does in the playoffs; you can play worse than you did in the regular season, and still come away with conference and Super Bowl championships as long as your offense plays well.",

If the Club World Cup is a dress rehearsal, the 2026 FIFA World Cup is the main event, the headliner, the one that’s been circled on every American soccer fan’s calendar for years. Surveys indicate that nearly 60% of American World Cup fans feel more patriotic during international sporting events like the World Cup.

Both F1 and NASCAR aren’t just races; they set standards. A lot of them draw inspiration from either F1 or NASCAR, whether it’s the racing format, the car design, or the rules. Two races capture the essence of these motorsports: F1’s Monaco Grand Prix and NASCAR’s Daytona 500. Formula 1 (F1) and NASCAR are two titans of racing, and the vehicles they employ in their contests are as different as night and day.

For example, scholars at the Urban Institute, a prominent liberal-leaning think tank, estimated that a single-payer program would require a federal spending increase of $34 trillion over ten years, and total American health care spending would increase by $7 trillion.

After dividing states into two groups, permanent disenfranchisement or voting rights restoration post-release, they found that individuals were approximately 10% less likely to recidivate if they were released in automatic restoration states versus permanent disenfranchisement states.17 Hamilton-Smith and Vogel posit that felony disenfranchisement creates community reintegration barriers for justice-impacted individuals which becomes an additional contributor to future criminality. In 2023, Minnesota and New Mexico restored the right to vote for over 57,000 justice-impacted persons who are on felony probation or parole.35 In 2020, Washington, DC, became the third jurisdiction in the continental United States where individuals incarcerated for a felony conviction can vote.36 While this is progress, felony disenfranchisement remains deeply entrenched in this country.",

Only nine U.S. states have laws that allow the state to disenfranchise people with felony convictions permanently (though the state may also choose to allow those with felony convictions to vote), while 15 states allow re-enfranchisement after prison, parole, and probation are complete.",

Each year since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on January 1, 1994, officials in Canada, Mexico, and the United States have regularly declared the agreement to be an unqualified success. NAFTA, while extending protections for investors, explicitly excluded any protections for working people in the form of labor standards, worker rights, and the maintenance of social investments. These reports, based in part on more comprehensive labor market surveys in all three countries,1 show that the impact on workers in each nation has been different according to their circumstances. Contrary to what the American promoters of NAFTA promised U.S. workers, the agreement did not result in an increased trade surplus with Mexico, but the reverse. As Bruce Campbell of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives reports, Canada’s increased market integration with the United States began in 1989 with the bilateral Free Trade Agreement, the precursor to NAFTA.",

In a recent study that de-emphasized the impact of NAFTA on the U.S. economy, economists David Autor (MIT), David Dorn (University of Zurich) and Gordon Hanson (University of California, San Diego) stress the role of China’s emergence on job growth and wages in the U.S. In the study, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, they write: “China’s emergence as a great economic power has induced an epochal shift in patterns of world trade.",

A 2016 report by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence concluded that “the public narrative cultivated by Snowden and his allies is rife with falsehoods, exaggerations, and crucial omissions” and that “the vast majority of the documents he stole have nothing to do with programs impacting individual privacy interests - they pertain instead to military, defense, and intelligence programs of great interest to America’s adversaries.”. His defenders included journalist Glenn Greenwald, *The Guardian* reporter who first published documents provided by Snowden that detail the NSA PRISM program to monitor the phone calls and emails of US citizens. “I never imagined that I would live to see our courts condemn the NSA’s activities as unlawful,” Snowden tweeted after the 2020 ruling. According to a May 2013 criminal complaint, the American government charged Snowden under the Espionage Act of 1917 with theft of government property, unauthorized communication of national defense information, and willful communication of classified communications intelligence information to an unauthorized person.",

As a result, some people will complain that they don’t want to speak up because they fear being “criticized” or “stigmatized.” These people should recognize that their fear isn’t a sign of the environment’s political correctness or hostility toward free expression; it’s just a sign that they need more courage—for it requires courage to stay engaged with difference.",

But as the U.S. population ages, the burden of financing retirement benefits on American workers is set to increase.[88] To avoid this, Social Security should be better focused on assuring a floor of income to retirees, while Medicare should be reformed to ensure that costs are considered before additional health-care services are added to its standard benefit package.[89] Better targeting can also improve the effectiveness of assistance for the unemployed, while alleviating the payroll-tax burden on current workers.[90].",

The Supreme Court has interpreted this clause to place primary responsibility with the states for redistricting, but it also clearly preserves the ability of Congress to set federal rules as appropriate. Numerous states have had to redistrict following judicial rulings that their maps violate principles of the Constitution or other laws around redistricting. In Rucho v Common Cause (2019), the Supreme Court held that claims of partisan gerrymandering present political questions beyond the reach of federal courts, effectively leaving it up to plaintiffs to prove that any redistricting harm stems from something beyond party affiliation. Redistricting is a state process but is also governed by the U.S. Constitution, federal law, and judicial precedent. In most states, the legislature is responsible for drawing both their congressional and legislative district lines, typically through the standard lawmaking process and often subject to gubernatorial veto.",

Maps in Texas and Florida are especially skewed, but North Carolina provides one of the most striking examples of the power of gerrymandering to affect the balance of power, not only in a state but nationally. Free to gerrymander, the Republican-controlled legislature redrew the map, and after the 2024 election, North Carolina saw three Democratic districts flip to Republicans, enough to give control of the U.S. House to the GOP by a slim margin. In 2022, the House passed the **Freedom to Vote Act**, a landmark piece of federal democracy reform legislation that would have prohibited mid-decade redistricting and banned partisan gerrymandering in congressional map drawing.",

Mr. Douthat is an Opinion columnist and the host of the “Interesting Times” podcast. I tend to be pretty skeptical of this scenario: America has outlasted challengers before and China seems to me to have remarkable strengths, yes, but also serious weaknesses. Dan Wang is a keen observer of contemporary China, and his new book,” Breakneck: China’s Quest to Engineer the Future,” argues that the Trump administration’s current trade war is wrongheaded or too late, and that American pre-eminence can be preserved if we imitate the things that China is getting right. *Below is an edited transcript of an episode of “Interesting Times.” We recommend listening to it in its original form for the full effect.",

Some U.S. policymakers have asserted that some UN member states disproportionately focus on Israel in various UN bodies, including the Security Council, the General Assembly, and the Human Rights Council.57 Over the years, the United States has repeatedly vetoed or voted against resolutions involving Israel, opposed Palestinian membership in UN fora, and withheld funding to some UN entities that allegedly discriminate against Israel or support the Palestinians.58  **The People's Republic of China (PRC).** During the past decade, some U.S. policymakers have expressed concern about what they view as China's efforts to increase its role and influence in the United Nations.59 In the context of U.S.-PRC competition, the United States has sought to increase U.S. citizen representation in UN leadership and personnel positions.",

The initial Arab Spring was “like one giant Woodstock,” said Alaoui. “People might think that the region is stagnant, that we’ve simply gone back to the bad old days of Hosni Mubarak or other Arab autocrats who were exemplars of ossification and stagnation, but that masks a lot of change in the region currently happening,” said Tarek Masoud, Kennedy School Professor of Public Policy and the Sultan Qaboos bin Said of Oman Professor of International Relations. “The drivers of the change are not the photogenic, admirable, creative young people who brought us the Arab Spring,” he said. “My belief is that the Saudi government looked at these uprisings of young people across the region and said, ‘If we don’t change things, we are going to find that happening here, and we’re not going to be able to weather it,’” said Masoud.",

In a recent survey in 10 Arab nations (Algeria, Morocco, Libya, Tunisia, Egypt, Sudan, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Palestinian Territories),1 we measured public attitudes toward the Arab Spring protests, its goals, and its beneficiaries. In our survey, respondents were asked to rank the goals of the Arab Spring protests from a list that includes increasing political freedoms, reducing corruption, enhancing dignity, improving the economic situation, and promoting social justice, among others. On average, fewer than 20 percent of respondents agreed that the goals of economic improvement and social justice were reached, despite ranking these as the top two goals of the Arab Spring protests. Survey respondents’ views on how various ethno-religious groups benefited from or were harmed by the Arab Spring process reveal notable signs of the way these groups are perceived by the society at large (Figure 8).",

On all the major social issues-abortion, quotas, gay rights, feminism, crime and punishment, the family, moral and religious values-the Reagan administration has been conservative and correct, even if reasonable people might quarrel over details of policy and political strategy. All told, in my judgment as a conservative Democrat, President Reagan will be remembered more for the opportunities that slipped from his grasp than for achievements that reshaped the American political landscape.

If no candidate wins the necessary 270 electoral votes, the House of Representatives convenes in a “contingent election” and determines the winner with each state delegation getting one vote. Most controversies involving the Electoral College occurred when candidates win the popular vote but lose the Electoral College vote. The NPVIC is a legally binding agreement among states to award the electoral votes from their state to the national popular vote winner, regardless of whether the majority of voters in that state preferred another candidate. The NPVIC would only go into effect should the states in the agreement represent an electoral majority of at least 270 electoral votes. Currently, candidates focus on a handful of “battleground” states such as Ohio and Florida with close vote-margins and large electoral vote payouts.",

According to Rufus King, “It was with the people that the Constitution meant to place the election of the Chief Magistrate.” The Constitution’s Electoral College Clause (Article II, section 1, clause 3) stipulates that electors from each state shall elect the president. However, most states adopted popular election of presidential electors in the 1810s and 1820s. Abolishing the Electoral College, however, would change the structure of the presidency to make it easier for popularly elected presidents to concentrate power in the executive branch. But the fact remains that a majority of the Electoral College elect’s presidents, not a majority of all Americans. Abolishing the Electoral College in favor of the popular vote would strengthen a president’s claim to speak for a majority of the American people.",

The Electoral College was also intended to prevent states with larger populations from having undue influence and to compromise between electing the president by popular vote and letting Congress choose the president. Even Donald Trump, who benefited from the Electoral College system, stated after the 2016 presidential election that he believed presidents should be chosen by popular vote: “I would rather see it where you went with simple votes.

In May of 2019, the Washington State Supreme Court **upheld** a state election law that said an elector who did not vote for the candidate he pledged to support could be fined up to $1,000 in civil penalties.

In Sudan, if the war-related famine again becomes severe, dividing the country into an Arab north and a Christian south may save the vast majority of threatened Sudanese lives at the lowest cost in dollars—and in the blood of intervening troops. But muscular interventions in wars like those in Angola and Congo will probably not happen until more countries develop the military capabilities for such operations—which brings us to the final question. Although the United States need not create a specialized armed force for peace operations, it should modify its military force structure to lessen the strain of various types of limited missions around the world. Even if such countries cannot be expected to lead forcible interventions, they can provide valuable combat forces that enable peacekeeping missions to uphold ceasefires and peace accords under challenge.",

Beyond the rise in ideological consistency, another major element in polarization has been the growing contempt that many Republicans and Democrats have for the opposing party. Nearly two-thirds (63%) of consistent conservatives and about half (49%) of consistent liberals say most of their close friends share their political views.

Obama’s lasting impact on American life may turn out to have been greatest in terms of the crises that did not happen. In a C-SPAN survey of 91 historians, political scientists, and other presidential scholars, Obama was ranked 12th among all presidents since George Washington for the overall quality of his performance as chief executive.

To name just a few central examples: the sheer hysteria about a modest healthcare bill – frequently labelled ‘the death of freedom’ by GOP politicians; the insane efforts to label Obama un-American (led by Trump!) and a dangerous Muslim; and, as important, the procedural radicalism of the congressional Republicans, engineered by the party’s top strategist, senate leader Mitch McConnell (shutting down the government, insisting on a supermajority requirement for every bill, denying Obama the right to fill the supreme court vacancy caused by the death of Justice Scalia, and much else).",

And from then on, the Obama presidency struggled under a radicalized Republican Party. Coleman notes, “In the summer of 2012, under pressure from party activists to show some effort on immigration reform before the November election and unable to rise above the partisanship that dominated Washington as he had hoped, President Obama turned to his executive powers and announced the creation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.” But again we see the weakness of executive action.",

Things we call \"hate speech\" might occasionally fall into an existing 1st Amendment exception: a racist speech might seek to incite imminent violence against a group, or might be reasonably interpreted as an immediate threat to do harm.",

This implies that concessions by elites to protester demands will be more likely during peak cycles of protest.”  The author analyzed whether protest is systematically related to two types of concessions: establishing a CRB and lowering fatalities of minorities. The author ultimately found that protests influence cities to establish more powerful citizen oversight boards and that they lower fatalities in minority communities.

On April 6, 2005, Greenspan called for a substantial increase in the regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac: \"Appearing before the Senate Banking Committee, the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, said the enormous portfolios of the companies—nearly a quarter of the home-mortgage market—posed significant risks to the nation's financial system should either company face significant problems.\" Despite this, Greenspan still claims to be a firm believer in free markets, although in his 2007 biography he wrote, \"History has not dealt kindly with the aftermath of protracted periods of low risk premiums\" as seen before the credit crisis of 2008.",

He added that the research team's work will continue to focus on looking for life on other planets: \"Keep watching this space.\". But even if the Cambridge team obtains a five sigma result, that won't be conclusive proof that life exists on the planet, according to Prof Catherine Heymans of Edinburgh University and Scotland's Astronomer Royal, who is independent of the research team.

Research from Fidelity Digital Assets® suggests that the overall volatility is decreasing, and could continue to drop.1 Advocates believe that if the current trend of increasing adoption holds (meaning more people continue to buy and hold bitcoin), price stability will increase, and fluctuations will decrease. **The bear argument** While criminal transactions are made with all kinds of currencies, critics argue that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies make these kinds of transactions even easier. **The bear argument** Even some of the industry's biggest supporters think alternative cryptocurrencies could eventually overthrow bitcoin as the largest crypto currency by market cap. 1.

Each year since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on January 1, 1994, officials in Canada, Mexico, and the United States have regularly declared the agreement to be an unqualified success. NAFTA, while extending protections for investors, explicitly excluded any protections for working people in the form of labor standards, worker rights, and the maintenance of social investments. These reports, based in part on more comprehensive labor market surveys in all three countries,1 show that the impact on workers in each nation has been different according to their circumstances. Contrary to what the American promoters of NAFTA promised U.S. workers, the agreement did not result in an increased trade surplus with Mexico, but the reverse. As Bruce Campbell of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives reports, Canada’s increased market integration with the United States began in 1989 with the bilateral Free Trade Agreement, the precursor to NAFTA.",

In a recent study that de-emphasized the impact of NAFTA on the U.S. economy, economists David Autor (MIT), David Dorn (University of Zurich) and Gordon Hanson (University of California, San Diego) stress the role of China’s emergence on job growth and wages in the U.S. In the study, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, they write: “China’s emergence as a great economic power has induced an epochal shift in patterns of world trade.",

As **Figure** **C** shows, the high-union-density states (listed in Table 1) have a higher average state minimum wage ($11.40) than the medium- and low-union-density states (at $9.22 and $8.10, respectively). In our analysis, we see the same pattern for personal well-being as for economic well-being: States with high unionization not only have higher minimum wages and higher median household incomes, but they also have higher health insurance coverage rates than states with low unionization. It is worth noting that the data underlying Figures G and H also underscore an important connection between unionization rates, health outcomes, economic security, and racial disparities: Many of the low- and medium-density-states that have the highest shares of uninsured residents, and many of the states that have not expanded Medicaid, also have relatively high concentrations of Black workers.",

The main difference between investing in real estate and investing in stocks is that real estate involves buying properties and renting them out or investing in REITs (real estate investment trusts), whereas investing in stocks involves buying a small slice of a company and waiting for those shares to increase in value. It’s also important to know that you can purchase shares in real estate investments without the headaches of actually buying, managing and selling properties. There are lots of metrics you can look at when figuring out if investing in real estate or stocks will make you more money. * Real estate investments can be more work than stocks.

Conversely, if the app is predominantly aimed at markets where the iPhone has a stronger presence than Android devices, going for iOS is the preferable option.",

Like Android, the iOS Camera app has many useful tools beyond snapping photos (Credit: Angela Moscaritolo). Android lets you create 360-degree photos, whereas iOS users require a separate app for this feature. As mentioned, Android doesn't limit you to its own parental controls, allowing you to use third-party options like Aura and Bark.Google's Family Link app allows parents to view their kids' activity, approve app downloads, set screen time limits, lock their device, and track their location. Like Android, iOS has a mode that reduces distractions by letting you customize which notifications, calls, and apps are active (Credit: Zooey Liao/PCMag Composite; Gabriel Zamora).",

Some apps may not be released at all for Android phones. The App Store’s revenue model also serves the developers of high-quality apps better, which will guarantee safe and good apps for iPhone users in the future as well.

Cooper’s report also found that “the Raise the Wage Act would disproportionately help workers in poverty or near the poverty line” because “nearly half (46.7 percent) of all workers who would be affected by raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2024 have total family incomes within 200 percent of the poverty line,” demonstrating that raising the minimum wage would directly affect the working poor who have long been oppressed by stagnant wages. While there is validity in the fear that raising the minimum wage could negatively affect the working poor, through the impact a higher income would have on their means-tested benefits, using this fear as a justification for not pushing toward a higher minimum wage would be in service of systematic inequality.",

Thirty states and the District of Columbia have raised their minimum wages above the federal rate of $7.25 per hour. Twenty-eight states have raised their minimum wage since the last federal increase—some through legislation or ballot initiatives, and others through having adopted “indexing” provisions that authorize small automatic increases to the local minimum wage most years to keep pace with the rising cost of living. The Economic Policy Institute estimates that the Raise the Wage Act, which would raise the federal minimum wage to $17 per hour by 2030, would result in wage increases totaling more than $70 billion for roughly 22 million workers in communities across the country.

Still, the research reveals a bigger impact on the restaurant industry, where some small, less productive restaurants close while higher minimum wages raise worker retention rates at bigger, more productive restaurants—and even raise profits at those surviving businesses. Rao and Risch were able to examine revenue, employment, profits, and more following minimum wage increases in six states—thanks to panel data they built that match the universe of U.S. tax returns of independent businesses to the individual income tax returns of each of their workers and owners over a 10-year period. On the firm side, the average independent business in industries such as restaurants and retail is able to accommodate the minimum wage increases through higher revenues. It’s that strong, adverse effect on some small firms that helps explain opposition to minimum wage increases among some small business owners, the researchers say.",

If a $500,000 home appreciates, even a small percentage annually, the owner earns that return on the entire value of the house, not just the down payment. * Home value after 10 years = roughly $671,000. This dynamic lends credence to the view that buying a home is typically a long-term investment rather than a one- or two-year flip. The financial obligations of owning a home don’t stop at the mortgage payment. * Property taxes (typically 1%–2% of the home's value annually). As a rule of thumb, assume 1%–2% of the home’s value every year. Those who can afford the down payment, mortgage, and subsequent costs, and who also have the patience and flexibility to endure the long time horizon often required, could potentially find a home purchase turning into a valuable asset.

The gap between the two consoles is widening, too; stats suggest that for every one Xbox Series X/S bought during November 2024, five PlayStation 5 consoles were also purchased (a ratio no doubt helped by the launch of the PS5 Pro.) Sony’s Game and Network Services also saw a healthy 12.3% bump in its profits during the final months of 2024, helped specifically by healthy first-party sales including Astro Bot selling 1.5 million copies in under two months, and lifetime sales for Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut surpassing 13 million.",

Any moral obligation to pay for something that can be gotten for free without stealing it is a separate debate from piracy. # Piracy is not morally wrong. As piracy does not take anything from creators, and is not stealing, I say that piracy is not morally wrong, despite not giving anything to those creators for compensation.

They, along with Jackson School of Global Affairs Dean James Levinsohn and School of Management Professor Barry Nalebuff, examined the impact of Musk's partisan actions on Tesla vehicle sales in the U.S. since October 2022. They found that not only would Tesla sales have been 67-83% higher without Musk’s partisan effect — equating to 1-1.26 million more vehicles sold — but Musk’s actions also boosted sales of other electric and hybrid vehicles by 17-22%. “The effect has been increasing over time, such that by the first quarter of 2025, we found that Tesla sales would have been about 125% higher than they were without the Musk partisan effect,” Kotchen said.",

I take it from Branko’s letter that he means Greed I is good for the economy because being successful on competitive markets requires Greed I, and Greed I is morally acceptable because it follows logically from the conditions of capitalist competition. Despite Branko’s words, it would be hard to make the case that Greed II is good either morally or for the economy. It’s probably the most important way that socially responsible firms manage to overcome what would often be the serious cost disadvantages that make Professor Milanovic skeptical about there being a productive role for morality in the capitalist system.",

An internet troll is someone who intentionally and aggressively harasses people online with disruptive, offensive, or inflammatory comments. According to Miller, trolls can often exhibit deeper, darker traits linked to antisocial behavior, aggression, and cyberbullying. The same behaviors that fuel cyberbullies—hate speech, doxxing, misinformation—are frequently present in internet trolls and are linked to specific personality traits. “Constructs like psychopathy and narcissism and even sadism are pretty regularly linked to online trolling behaviors,” Miller says. The ability to hide behind a pseudonym and encrypted networks gives internet trolls the security they need to act out against real people, from bullying your neighbors to insulting or even threatening celebrities and politicians. It’s harder for an internet troll to act out this behavior in the real world, where jailtime or a simple punch in the face might be the consequences. “However, research suggests that those who consistently troll others online are often difficult people offline, too.",

Multiple opinions have pointed towards India's rapid economic development as a reason for it to be considered a potential superpower, in particular during the 2010s when it was predicted to outpace China's growth into the future.

Mr. Douthat is an Opinion columnist and the host of the “Interesting Times” podcast. I tend to be pretty skeptical of this scenario: America has outlasted challengers before and China seems to me to have remarkable strengths, yes, but also serious weaknesses. Dan Wang is a keen observer of contemporary China, and his new book,” Breakneck: China’s Quest to Engineer the Future,” argues that the Trump administration’s current trade war is wrongheaded or too late, and that American pre-eminence can be preserved if we imitate the things that China is getting right. *Below is an edited transcript of an episode of “Interesting Times.” We recommend listening to it in its original form for the full effect.",

Republican support is much higher than it was in May 2020, when 56% favored more fracking. More broadly, majorities of Democrats oppose all forms of fossil fuel development we asked about in our recent survey, including offshore oil and gas drilling, hydraulic fracturing, and coal mining. While Republicans express broad support for fracking overall, there are notable differences of opinion within the GOP by age.

Although the fate of its most-convinced adherents, the dot-coms, offers a cautionary lesson, managers’ faith that first-mover status brings important competitive advantages, even when network effects are not available to accelerate and entrench it, remains undiminished. Business executives from every kind of company maintain, almost without exception, that early entry into a new industry or product category gives any firm an almost insuperable head start.

Advocates of a wealth tax argue that it would be an effective means of raising revenues while addressing wealth and income inequality and affecting only a tiny fraction of U.S. households. To illustrate the basic concept, consider a simple example of a 2 percent wealth tax imposed on all individual or household net worth above $100 million (the exemption threshold). ### A Wealth Tax Would Raise Revenues. Using those estimates, if a 1 percent wealth tax were imposed on all assets comprising that base and no evasion occurred, the tax would raise an additional $94 billion, or about 3 percent of total federal revenues in 2019; if enforcement were weak and base erosion were 50 percent, the amount of revenues raised would be half as large.",

Under her plan, high-wealth taxpayers would likely pay taxes on their capital gains each year as their assets appreciate in value. Even a very wealthy individual may not have the liquid assets to pay the tax on their changes in wealth.

LCCs target primarily infrequent leisure travelers who choose flights primarily based on lowest price, even if the flights are less convenient and less reliable. Interlining agreements between airlines, especially those within an alliance, also often include allowing passengers to through-check their bags across multiple carriers instead of needing to re-check at connections. Perhaps one of the biggest differences between legacy carriers and LCCs is that legacy carriers typically have extensive loyalty programs designed to entice their highest-profit customers to keep their flying within that airline and its partners rather than shopping around for the cheapest flight for each trip.",

Conversely, low-cost carriers can experiment with new routes more than most full-service airlines. * Southwest Airlines | low-cost carrier | operates only Boeing 737 family aircraft. * Frontier Airlines | low-cost carrier | operates only Airbus A320 family aircraft.

Environmental sustainability and climate-neutral delivery options rank comparatively lower when consumers are asked which factors they prioritize with regard to e-commerce delivery. Given that consumers want free shipping, but parcel delivery rates have been rising, both shippers and providers could benefit from designing and offering creative fulfillment options. Consumers crave options and flexibility when it comes to e-commerce deliveries.
