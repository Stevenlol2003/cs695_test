This is what makes a legend. Similarly, Kobe took over game four in the 2000 finals with an injured ankle. He also won finals with a damaged index finger. His work ethic and ambition were inspiring. He was a rip-your-heart-out-and-watch-it-beat-in-his-hands kind of player, regardless of his physical condition. While LeBron can demolish every opponent, many argue that his spirit is different than Kobe’s. It is thought that LeBron lacks the magic touch that Kobe possessed, which sets a player apart from the rest. The ability to perform when it matters most, against all odds, which Kobe did repeatedly, defines real legends."}

Putin has faced evidence-based accusations of meddling in both the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. What’s more, he’s previously been voted “Person of the Year” by the Organized Crime and Corruption Project , due to his alleged engagement with the mafia to launder money and promote interests abroad . Additionally, suspicious deaths seem to happen to people who oppose Putin or try to expose political corruption. Prior to the recent death in an Arctic prison of opposition leader Alexei Navalny , others who have publicly criticized Putin for a myriad of reasons, ranging from corruption to Ukraine to his coronavirus response, have died of mysterious illnesses or by “accidental” falls from windows. A notable incident also occurred in 2018 that involved the poisoning of a Russian ex-spy and his daughter, while both were in England. Though Putin denies any connection, such cases don’t make for a trustworthy resume. Nor do media reports assert that he’s not only aware of but lauds acts of torture being carried out at the hands of his soldiers in Ukraine."}

Refraining from using the word “retarded” to mean “stupid” is a basic show of respect for anybody who is cognitively impaired. While PC culture may sometimes feel a bit forced or insincere, its intention is to be respectful and not to insult anyone. Even if we overdo it, it is a work in progress, which may take time to find a healthy balance that is easier to live up to.

He supported, for example, raising auditing standards after the Enron scandal, and in the words of his successor, Ben Bernanke , “rarely resisted regulatory initiatives put forth by the Federal Reserve Board staff.” His resistance to regulation of derivatizes and other financial innovations stemmed from his belief that they were useful in deconcentrating risk, which at the time was not a radical view. Even today, with the benefit of hindsight, top economic minds are unsure of the right levels of regulation. While Greenspan admitted his faith in regulation was tested by the crisis , the problem was not his dogmatism. It was the complexity of the challenges faced by the Fed during this period."}

Molding young players in the ways he saw fit, Auerbach offered a springboard to players like John Havlicek, who then became the engine behind many of the championships they won together. In 1978, it was Auerbach’s vision that drove the Celtics to draft Larry Bird, who was still relatively unknown. He turned out to be one of the greatest players the NBA has ever seen.

That`s difficult to do, to say the least. During playoff games, this is when defense wins. Defense is about hard work, and it allows players to be competitive during games when nothing else works for their team. As the Kansas City Chiefs defensive lineman Chris Jones showed in the 2023 AFC championship game, a good defensive play can end the other team’s offensive run before it even begins. The team’s defense again played a key role in their 2nd consecutive Super Bowl victory.

Exports to Mexico alone have risen from $43 billion in 1993 to $243 billion. Without NAFTA, US businesses would be less competitive .

There is poor quality of air and water in many areas, hurting the overall health of the nation, with limited resources allocated to preventative healthcare. Also, the country’s economy is largely dependent on the price of oil – which is dangerous given the Biden administration’s 500+ sanctions in addition to the hundreds of other sanctions imposed on the country by the EU, UK and other countries, which are intended to curb its exports of oil and minerals in addition to freezing its currency reserves.

Also, nobody who has ever watched Serena Williams play tennis can deny that sheer skill is what has won her 23 Grand Slam titles (although her muscles definitely help). While men and women may differ in physicality, they do not differ in their skills capacity. This is why former tennis star John McEnroe faced backlash in 2017 when he dismissed Williams as the sport’s greatest tennis player and, instead, clarified that she may be the sport’s best female player. A more recent show of skills: female college basketball star Caitlin Clark , just made history, surpassing NBA star Steph Curry’s three-point shot record.

This rendered the dollar the most important currency in the world, and as a result, the US became the world’s foundation for economic stability.

Official burqa bans could help women who might be ambivalent about removing their burqas make a decision that will better ensure their safety.

Many of Liang’s supporters shouted, “All Lives Matter,” claiming that he was a scapegoat because he was not white and that he should not be jailed. However, Black activists pointed out that Liang was tried by a jury of his peers and deserved to be jailed for his actions. Using “All Lives Matter” to demand freedom for someone who was convicted of murdering an unarmed Black man is nothing more than demanding that white privilege be extended to all people of color except for Black Americans."}

In 2012, a behavioral economist teamed up with a Sports Illustrated journalist to write “ Scorecasting : The Hidden Influences behind How Sports Are Played and Games Are Won,” in which they analyzed data from 45 Super Bowls. A worn claim by the defense advocates is that the top-ranked defense during the regular NFL football season won 15 Super Bowls, whereas the top-ranked offense won only eight. The authors’ deeper look into statistics contradicts this claim. They assert that 38 out of 45 Super Bowls have been won by a top 10 defense and 22 have been won by a top 3 defense. Meanwhile, 38 Super Bowls have been won by a top 10 offense and 20 were won by a top 3 offense. So, if you widen the sample size, the differences are marginal, if they even exist."}

Instead, it was used to begin a space race with a car of Musk’s own making, a project Musk defended as something “silly and fun.” Additionally, his Hyperloop project – estimated to cost millions – has been criticized as a parallel transportation network intended for catering to the rich . With money and power often comes hubris, and it seems as though Musk isn’t an exception to this rule.

Mulan is too awkward for an arranged marriage; Belle from Beauty and Beast has a feminist side not warmly embraced by her town; Ratatoullie’s Remy is ousted from his community for his culinary flare, and… let’s do talk about Bruno from Encanto, whose power seeing the future get him outcasted. While each of these characters is out of step with their surroundings, their exceptionality eventually leads to greatness. Mulan becomes a warrior who prevents an invasion; Belle finds love and happiness without compromising; Remy becomes a gourmet chef; and Bruno’s vision propels Mirabel, the story’s protagonist, to ultimately save her family. Disney’s outcasts challenge society’s norms and invite young viewers to challenge them as well. Many Disney movies also directly or indirectly promote lessons of tolerance, showing that it can be rewarding to accept others for who they are, even – or especially – if they are different."}
{"id": 47, "content": "Though the popularity of Netflix, and streaming in general, is growing exponentially, the majority of TV shows have been written with the intention of building anticipation ; their writers have historically relied on the fact that there is a week between each episode in which you’ll be waiting to see what happens next. Binge-watching, by contrast, doesn’t provide the time needed for after-thoughts and discussions, central to the community-building experience. Viewer discussions around mystery or action TV shows, like “Did Daenerys Targaryen really have to destroy Kings Landing?” or “Did Tony Soprano live or die?” are less likely to happen when the mystery is solved or reasoning explained minutes after the question was posed. Additionally, the binge-watching phenomenon attests to the lack of patience that characterizes modern society. We’re used to getting everything immediately and aren’t good at waiting for things we want. Our need for instant gratification (and our inability to delay gratification) may not be good for people over time, and binge-watching is a major example of this problem."}

It’s not the UN’s fault that international human rights are trampled on, but the organization seems powerless to stop it. Take the genocide in Rwanda , where the UN had an “Assistance Mission” established in 1994. Its members were aware of the impending genocide, but UN peacekeepers failed to stop the majority Hutus from murdering almost a million minority Tutsis. Another example is the 2005 rape and sexual abuse against Congolese children, perpetuated by UN peacekeepers themselves. Subsequent reports found similar allegations in other countries. Most recently, the UN and its UN Women organization have been called out for ignoring and/or denying Hamas members’ brutal and systemic rape of Israeli women on Oct. 7, 2023. If the UN doesn’t speak out against such human rights violations, what’s its purpose for existing?"}

The consistently high demand for plumbers, electricians, and other vocations (and even non-vocations) garner their practitioners handsome wages that are generally comparable with (if not higher than) positions pursued by degree-holders. For example, the starting and even median salary and growth for a plumber is on par with that of a teacher . To be sure, both plumbers and teachers deal with plenty of crap, but the plumber pays significantly less than the amount that a teacher pays to begin his/career, and begins earning and advancing sooner, too. (Not to mention, plumbers aren’t exposed to the fear and stress related to possible gun violence at their place of work.) So, is college worth it? Let’s remember that elbow grease can be just as effective as a college education when it comes to making a living."}

More importantly, cats aren’t dependent on their owners to go to the bathroom. Sure, kitty litter can smell if it isn’t changed regularly, but you can store and change it at your convenience. Not to mention, some cats can be trained to actually use the toilet . In contrast, dogs don’t care if there’s rain, snow or extreme heat outside. When they need a walk, there’s no avoiding it. And even if you have a yard, you’ll still need to do constant poop control outside. Plus, cats groom themselves and don’t emit bad smells. Not even the most ardent dog lover can deny that their furry companion has a distinctly strong odor, which often remains on clothes, furniture and in cars after they’ve gone."}

The Hall of Fame actually has a morality clause that refers to a player’s record, integrity, playing ability, character, sportsmanship, and contributions to his team as considerations for induction . Being recognized as top professionals in any field is an honor, which deserves respect. The Baseball Hall of Fame is a beautiful tradition that deserves to stay clean. This means leaving players who used PED out of it. After all, the players who used steroids chose not to play the game fairly. Nobody is asking to put them in jail, just not to give them baseball’s highest honor – as a Hall of Famer."}

An estimated 46 million Americans have student loan debts. As 65% of college students graduate with debt, starting your business right out of college will dig an even deeper hole into your already-empty wallet. Working a full-time job, on the other hand, will allow you to find your financial footing, so that you’ll have savings to fall back on after venturing off on your own. And, when it comes to looking for investments, teamwork experience is a MAJOR factor in the likelihood of raising funds – experience you need to first gain."}

People buy new items, store them inappropriately, forget purchases, regret purchases and launch new decluttering operations. It’s human nature. The concept that people tidy once and never have to tidy again, even after acquiring new belongings, is unrealistic for most people. Such a philosophy expects too much of people; such a commitment to the process of tidying up takes energy and time; if it is abandoned halfway through or left unfinished, it may leave people feeling worse about themselves and their home than when they started."}
{"id": 54, "content": "The US’s drone campaign has been essential in the War on Terror. Drones proved adept in reaching the remote areas of Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Syria, among other countries, where the Taliban, Al-Qaeda and ISIS, among others, conducted (and still do) their terrorist activities. Daniel Blyman, a researcher with the Center for Middle East Policy, points out that drone strikes not only “defanged” al-Qaeda by neutralizing high-ranking combatants (and even the highest-ranking leaders, as was the case with Biden’s 2022 drone strike against Osama bin Laden’s predecessor, Ayman al-Zawahiri ), but also made it nearly impossible for them to train new combatants, convene, or use telecommunications of any kind. More than accomplishing American counterterrorism objectives, drone strikes are often the only defense local communities in tribal regions of countries like Pakistan and Afghanistan have against terrorist groups that tyrannize them. For those who are regularly subjected to suicide bombings or whose children risk being abducted and taken to terrorist training camps, drone strikes provide a much-welcomed reprieve from terrorists’ violence. Not to mention, drone technology keeps advancing to make them even more efficient and effective: Take for instance just one development that allows operators to coordinate multiple drones simultaneously and overwhelm aggressors’ defensive capabilities."}

A polar bear swimming figure eights with no intention of stopping? Yes, they may look cute doing it, but these are actually signs of severe distress and animal insanity – also known as zoochosis . Animals in captivity often suffer from this severe psychological condition . This condition occurs due to deprivation, loneliness, and stress – all caused by captivity. It’s not just land animals that suffer; marine life , especially marine mammals, in public aquariums also show stereotypic (neurotic) behavior, such as repeatedly raising their heads above the surface of the water, spinning around an imaginary object, and frequently turning on one side and rubbing along the floor of the tank."}

Magic played with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , arguably the best center to have ever played the game, and with James Worthy , a No. 1 draft pick, three-time NBA champion, and one of the 50 greatest players in NBA history. Bird, himself, is what made the Celtics great. With Bird, the Celtics shot from 29 wins to 60 wins in a regular season. His spirit and mentality positively affected the entire team. This is not to say that his teammates were bad players, but Robert Parish , Dennis Johnson and Cedric Maxwell , to mention a few, were not as talented as the Lakers’ players at that time. Bird had less to work with, and without him, the Celtics would probably be a mediocre team, which cannot be said about Magic."}
{"id": 57, "content": "There is evidence that content creators can actually benefit from piracy. For an actor or a musician, exposure is everything. Success is generally measured by a song or clip having “ gone viral ,” and accessibility to said media – i.e. through illegal downloading sites – is a key component of making that happen. A few years ago, the EU withheld a study that found that piracy had less of an impact on sales than originally thought. It found that copyright infringement of music, books, and video games in Europe didn’t necessarily detract from sales; in this vein, musicians at least generally don’t expect their tracks to be bought. After building their brand, musicians’ incomes are instead rooted in merchandise and live performances. Additionally, revenue from the music streaming industry is sharply increasing each year, underscoring the fact that a new economy, defined by new norms, has emerged, and it’s here to stay."}
{"id": 58, "content": "Taxing the rich to pay for programs that help the poor and middle class (or on things like infrastructure or national defense, which benefit all Americans) makes common sense economically, especially during a pandemic . Very simply, money allocated to programs such as affordable healthcare, Pell grants, food stamps, and Earned Income Tax Credit – or given to working- and middle-class Americans through tax cuts – will be redistributed into the economy and stimulate growth. Tax hikes on the rich would have little impact on their spending, since most of this income would likely have gone into savings. History bears this out. President Clinton raised the top marginal income tax rate from 31 to 39.6 percent and saw GDP growth top 4 percent every year in his second term. Meanwhile, President George W. Bush’s tax cuts were supposed to accelerate growth but, instead, they led to unimpressive growth and eventually recession."}

Meanwhile, 34 million Americans live in poverty, with half a million homeless on any given night. Even with higher tax rates (and fewer loopholes), the country’s wealthiest will be fine; billionaires like Bill Gates and conservative Mark Cuban, among others, attest to this, having said they would be willing to pay more in taxes. For the government to provide basic housing, nourishment, health care and education to the rest of its citizens, the money must come from somewhere. For the most fortunate to fail to pay their fair share would be a moral failure."}
{"id": 60, "content": "Although the culturally accepted norm, monogamy hasn’t necessarily been successful as a societal model. According to statistics, up to 50% of marriages experience an extramarital affair. It’s not surprising, then, that the US divorce rates have proven that monogamy in its purest form does not always work. It’s not surprising, then, that, today, 81% of Americans find divorce morally acceptable. Additionally, along with society’s increased awareness about issues surrounding gender identity , its tolerance for non-traditional relationships may have also expanded. In fact, more and more Americans are open to the concept of polyamorous relationships and 5% are even in consensual non-monogamous relationships. Even in countries that punish people, mainly women, for marital infidelity, many still look for partners outside of their monogamous marriage. This may indicate that, in the current cultural convention, monogamy isn’t necessarily the natural choice for human cohabitation."}

Traveling with kids means you’re paying for more seats on modes of transportation, more beds in hotels and more mouths at restaurants.

For adoptive families, knowledge of any medical or developmental problems among the birth family can help them to prepare and give better care to their child. This is especially the case if the birth mother engaged in an activity that may have adversely (or positively!) affected her baby’s health. For example, Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders are prevalent among children who are adopted from Eastern European countries, where there are high levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Without accurate family medical history, adoptees risk making crucial decisions about their health blindly or could end up paying for expensive diagnostic procedures or genetic testing in order to gain information that could be easily ascertained from the biological family."}

No one minds that Paltrow is capitalizing on her fame. After all, Jessica Alba and Reese Witherspoon, among other celebrities, also have brands that sell a wide range of lifestyle products.

Between 1993 and 2017, right-wing groups are said to have carried out 150 attacks on US soil – from shooting to bombings. Since 2017, there have been a number of far-right terror attacks in the US, not to mention their role in the US Capital riots .

{"id": 66, "content": "People who sit for more than eight or nine hours a day – a typical workday – are at heightened risk for diabetes, depression and, especially, back pain. Luckily, open floor plans tend to encourage employees to spend more time standing up and moving around. Employees can stretch their bodies and their minds, removing much physical and cognitive tension from the workday. Five minutes of motion every hour during the workday can lift employees’ moods, fight exhaustion without reducing attention, and even mitigate the effects of hunger pangs, a study reveals. Employees working out of open spaces are therefore likely to form more positive work associations, and experience less real and perceived pain as a result of the workday."}

Depression has been linked to an imbalance of neurotransmitters in the brain, meaning that the chemicals which are responsible for happiness, eating, sleeping, and other important biological functions are off-kilter. Antidepressants are small pills taken orally that seek to restore this imbalance. While a chemical imbalance is not the only potential cause of depression, studies show that 60-70% of depressed patients who take antidepressants respond positively , with symptoms eventually remitting."}
{"id": 68, "content": "Simply put, birth parents of children put up for adoption have not signed on to be parents. As such, there is no guarantee that even if they desire some contact with the child they placed, that they will commit to the relationship (or be a source of emotional comfort to the child) in the long-term. Birth parents withdraw from open adoption relationships with much more frequency than adoptive parents. When a birth parent is only sporadically involved or disappears altogether, the emotional consequences, i.e., a deep sense of rejection , for children can be devastating. As one adoption advocate puts it, “A child whose biological parent disappears experiences a double whammy. He wonders why he was placed to begin with, then feels rejected again because a birth mother no longer visits.”"}

In contrast, Leaf had a solid team with a good coach when he entered the league. Unlike Russell, Leaf failed to make it on other teams, which is clear evidence that the main problem was Leaf himself."}

In contrast, a completely open office space without any barriers can inhibit productivity . Researchers at Harvard have found that open work environments negatively affect collaboration, actually reducing face-to-face interactions by 70%. Plus, fewer screens or walls between employees, can lead to increased employee interruption, reduced levels of concentration and lower levels of motivation. Since it can take as long as 23 minutes for employees to get back on task and return to a fully engaged state, closed office layouts seem like a smart option to boost (and maintain) levels of concentration."}

Epidurals pose no adverse effects to fetal health, and severe side effects for mothers are uncommon. Moreover, in cases where mothers are affected by complex heart disease or a bad airway (as is common with obese patients), having an epidural early on in labor can help to control blood pressure and heart rate, and ultimately safeguards mothers against serious complications that can arise during delivery."}

This “burden of proof” becomes especially hard in times of despair. For example, while the loss of a loved one is a tragedy that we all have to bear, religion equips us to better to deal with such grief . For one thing, it provides a clear plan of action for a chaotic moment. The familiar ceremony of a funeral, wake or Shiva are all procedures that we can lean on in those, otherwise, overwhelming times. But more than that, for believers, religion provides the comfort in a notion that suffering is not random and that they are not alone. It provides an answer, which can be a major help with acceptance. It also provides hope. While the world collectively suffered from Covid-19 and its variants, searching for religion seemed to provide a common thread of hope around the world; when the pandemic was at its peak, a survey found that prayer-related internet searches in 75 different countries jumped to their highest level in five years."}

Despite interpretations of the bible indicating that abortion is forbidden, the holy texts themselves contain no direct prohibitions against termination. Abortion is not likened to homicide in any religious scripture. “For too long, the extreme Religious Right has dominated the public conversation about religion and sexuality,” Knox explained in an interview with ThinkProgress. “But the truth is that most people of faith, like the majority of Americans overall, support access to contraception, comprehensive sexuality education, and reproductive health care — including abortion.”"}

{"id": 79, "content": "Today, monogamy is the most common lifestyle choice, making it a lot easier to be accepted in society. One only has to look at the reasoning behind the movement from a polygamous to monogamous society in order to realize why it was natural: A study by the University of Waterloo shows that the concept originally developed when groups of people formed into societies, and people were becoming more and more exposed to sexually transmitted diseases. The way to treat these sexually transmitted epidemics was to become monogamous. Being monogamous was thought to be a safer way to live, and it transformed into what we know as parenthood once offspring came into the picture. Although we now have modern medicine, it is still safer to be in a monogamous relationship health-wise ; people in long-term monogamous marriages or relationships are less at risk of contracting STIs from each other or other partners."}

Forbidden from basic civic engagement, they used new tools such as social media to confront and defeat leaders seemingly entrenched in power.

Exposure to more mature peers has been proven to see younger students rise to the challenge.

He could pull off dazzling moves that excited fans everywhere and brought many new ones to the sport.

Michael Jordan is the best basketball player of our time because he won six rings ; the NFL’s Tom Brady is the best quarterback ever because he surpassed Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw by winning his seventh Super Bowl ring, and John Federer is the best tennis player ever because he has won 20 Grand Slams. Accordingly, the 1984 draft is not the best ever. Jordan, Olajuwon, Barkley, Thorpe and Stockton have nine rings combined. In contrast, the 1996 draft players – Bryant, Allen, Walker, Stojakovic, Fisher (who was picked in the 24th spot and played a key role in few LA Lakers championships) and Ben Wallace (not drafted) – have a total of fifteen rings."}

Indeed, the body-bending process is so jarring that a full quarter of new mothers walk away from childbirth with one or more PTSD symptoms. The pain caused by contractions raises blood pressure, stokes anxiety and can lead to stress-ridden birth experiences and an increased likelihood of post-partum depression.

This is where standardized tests are beneficial, given that personal interviews and demographic information automatically subject evaluations to bias and human error . Colleges and universities need some sort of unbiased tools with which to screen applicants. These tests help place students in the appropriate place of learning by removing bias from the equation. The SATs are not perfect, but they provide a good service in that vein. The SATs (and other standardized tests) are largely comprised of multiple-choice questions and scored by machines, and thus provide an objective, statistically reliable criteria through which to compare student success. The SATs also show students’ proficiencies in a narrow focus instead of having their entire academic career come under the microscope."}

Shouting “Black Lives Matter” could move the focus away from dealing with white privilege as a source of social inequality. Because the hashtag seems to reiterate that what matters are Black lives, it risks shining the spotlight on only one small aspect of a much bigger and more problematic issue. The “All Lives Matter” motto can serve as an umbrella slogan that opposes restricting privilege to just one group, instead of potentially implying that the problem could be solved if only Black Americans were included in the said privilege."}
{"id": 90, "content": "One of religion’s most important functions is that it acts as social glue. Religious beliefs provide a sense of shared meaning to many people. Moreover, religious rituals bring people together, allowing them to pay respects , socialize, forget about their problems to a certain degree, and feel part of something greater than themselves. During global coronavirus lockdowns, people felt comforted that they could still turn to their religious communities, even on Zoom . Doing so enabled otherwise isolated people to stay connected and spiritual. It makes sense, then that there’s been a 28% increase in the number of Americans turning to religious faith since the coronavirus pandemic hit. Anthropological studies show that participation in religious events increases group bonding and promotes prosocial behaviors. Through this ability to promote cooperation, religion has been instrumental in holding human societies together and has contributed to the rise of human civilization ."}

For example, a mere gallon of gas contains enough energy to charge an iPhone every day for almost 20 years . In comparison, the energy density in solar power is so low that even if you get enough solar power to charge your phone, it’ll most likely need to be recharged the very next day."}

His charitable Foundation contributes 10% of the World Health Organization ’s total budget, putting himself in a place to wield undue influence on the organization’s policies. Any individual with that much influence over an entire sector is concerning, as he shapes everything from the conversation surrounding global health to the decisions on which diseases to allocate what resources. The Foundation also has a multitude of partnerships with companies in the private sector involved in global health governance. This creates huge conflicts of interest when it comes to policy-making. Gates isn’t a doctor nor practiced in medicine, yet his opinions on global health are the ones that decide its future."}

By being able to easily turn off any smart appliances from your phone – within seconds – there’s no more reason to panic when you’re out of the house and suddenly realize that you’ve left the oven on. (Some smart appliances have been designed to turn themselves off when not in use.) For greater security, you can remotely lock any home doors you forgot to lock. You can also use smart appliances to monitor your home – and your loved ones inside. So, whether you’re sitting in your office 30 minutes away or on a business trip abroad, you can view your child or pet from afar and exchange voice messages with them through a toy or device. Automated technology offers peace of mind to parents about caretakers or loved ones left by themselves."}

According to the Pew Research Center, 57% of Americans feel that people today are too easily offended by what others say. And if that doesn’t seem representative of your milieu, it’s probably time to check your privilege. While PC culture claims to want to include everyone, calling someone out for using a “problematic” term or demanding that they adopt your speech norms is not only alienating and belittling, but a display of social cultural superiority . After all, the most reliable determinants for someone’s support of political correctness is their advantageous education and income . So is this kind of sensitivity actually doing anything for minorities or is it just the virtue signaling of the already-privileged?"}

This suggests that America’s preference for sugary drinks is part of a bigger problem. Therefore, a soda tax is merely a band-aid to treat a symptom. Instead, government intervention should be about working with communities toward finding sustainable ways to bring communities affordable, healthy groceries and dietary education programs. One initiative raises awareness about the unintended consequences of food and beverage taxes, especially for working families who can’t afford higher-priced groceries. An alternative would be for the government and soda industry to invest their resources in developing healthier and affordable beverage (and food) options for consumers."}

The top 1% of earners in American have greater wealth than the entire middle class. Wage stagnation, automation, and globalization have conspired to create the perfect storm for America’s once strong middle class . Wages that used to support one family fail to support a single person; technology has made hundreds of thousands of jobs obsolete; competition from cheap international labor forces drive American salaries down. In a political system where money determines legislation with more regularity than the public will, it is unlikely that a tax system that gives preference to its highest earners will be rewritten any time soon, and income inequality will affect more American families."}

In this regard, she is damaging to feminism in that she encourages onlookers to objectify her and women in general.

Having smaller, closed offices with fewer people may be particularly relevant and beneficial to offices that have been enforcing social distancing rules. Not to mention, with less shared office space also means fewer shared office supplies and physical interactions, an obvious plus when it comes to social distancing and lowering the risk of exposure to germs. Physical health aside, closed office space also improves employees’ emotional wellbeing, as they are less exposed to work-related stressors, including the need to appear in constant productivity. Indeed, it’s been suggested that employees working in closed offices tend to experience less age discrimination due to the exhibition of anxiety, cardiac issues and digestive problems caused by the stressful environment they are working in. These employees also experience less neurological problems, like vertigo, brought on by the busy open-space environment."}

This makes him able to defend all five positions on the floor, from point guards to power forwards. James also leads his team to defend as a unit, making it that much more effective. If they had ever played each other, James could have likely come out on top in terms of defense."}

Corporations thrive on using Google Hangouts to communicate and Google Calendar to share schedules between employees. Gmail has 1.5 billion users , which means the company has access to that many emails. Google Maps – which automatically comes with any Android phone – gives Google your exact location, at all times. None of this addresses the access the company has to your search history , from which they compile a profile of you in order to target you with relevant advertisements. Is Google too powerful? Consider this: Its search engine market share is 90% . The US government seems to think that Google is an illegal monopoly and is consequently suing the tech giant to break it up and halt alleged antitrust abuses. While Facebook gets a lot of flak for data manipulation , you have to choose to be on one of their three platforms to have your data compromised; Google, on the other hand, is practically the whole web , with minimal competitors , so no place is safe – not even your health records !

Even the name Scientology favors the empirical over the spiritual; this is also echoed in the book Dianetics, the religion’s foundational text, whose subtitle is “the Modern Science of Mental Health.” Manca contends that Hubbard’s motivations were financial, and that he would realize them by any means necessary, whether that meant selling his work as the fruit of science or of a supreme being."}

The population explosion was posited by a Stanford University biologist who claimed in the late 1960s that the Earth’s predicted rapid population growth in the 1970s and 1980s would lead to mass famine and carnage. Believers advocated for broad public action, including taxes on children and compulsory birth control. Small families became en vogue in America, and in a more extreme answer to this perceived problem, 8 million sterilizations were performed in India. In the end, there was no food crisis; food security dramatically increased in the 1980s, but it was too late for the thousands of Indian women who would never bear children. This is a clear example of how sometimes even scientists get things wrong."}

This can, perhaps, limit the potential for political conflicts, wars and, especially, price volatility. Renewable energy is already providing affordable electricity across the United States . The trend is soaring as costs to generate electricity from solar and wind power are steadily declining . In fact, in 2019, US renewable energy consumption surpassed coal for the first time in over 130 years. While renewable energy facilities are costly to build, once built, operations are low-cost, especially as the fuel is free for most renewable technologies. This leads to relatively stable renewable energy prices over time. In contrast, fossil fuel prices are vulnerable to dramatic price swings. Increasing our reliance on renewable energy can also help protect consumers when fossil fuel prices jump."}

But this decline has much more to do with modernization than with globalization. Increasing productivity, driven in large part by technological advances , has allowed companies to do more with fewer workers. While the first decade of the 21st century saw manufacturing jobs falling, manufacturing output actually grew by $800 billion over the same period . Simply put, if new technology allows one person to do the job previously done by five, it will benefit the consumer and the firm, but cost jobs in that sector. While, according to some estimates, NAFTA led to a net loss of around 100,000 jobs through 2010, this number should be looked at on a macro level. Yes, this was significant for those workers and their families, but at just 0.1 percent of the US labor force, this figure is far from economically crippling."}

Other research suggests that milk may lead to an increased risk of cancer due to the levels of IGF-1 growth hormones found in milk. While this hormone is normally found in our blood, higher levels of it may stimulate certain cancer cells. Then, there’s a milk allergy , which can be life-threatening. Symptoms range from wheezing to vomiting to a possibly fatal anaphylactic reaction. To a lesser degree, there’s also lactose intolerance.

Even in cases where a guilty plea cancels out the need for a trial, seeking the death penalty costs almost twice as much as cases that don’t.

The theory is drawn that kids who are among the oldest in their clas s have a developmental advantage that boosts the odds that they’ll excel in school , on the sports field, and in many other aspects of life. In fact, researchers found that grade-schoolers who are among the oldest in their class have a competitive advantage. The same study showed that high-school students who were among the oldest in their class were nearly 12% more likely to enroll in a four-year college or university and 15.4% less likely to get into trouble with the law while underage."}

Who doesn’t (secretly) love to see a Kardashian marriage fail ( more than once ), or watch an undeservingly rich Real Housewife make a fool of herself at a party? But capitalizing on negativity treats it as currency, and currency affects both internal and external environments. As social creatures, humans are not only sensitive to the emotions that others create, but they also involuntarily mimic them. By mere force of our neurology, we internalize reality TV’s negativity, bring it into our own environment, where it lingers, and wait for the next person to pass it forward."}

His most recent partnership with T-Mobile will make cellphone service available almost everywhere in the US, even remote corners. His car company Tesla has steered the automotive industry towards a new era with semi-autonomous vehicles and electric cars, globally reducing vehicle emissions. Because of Musk, analysts now believe that over half the cars sold by 2040 will be electric. In fact, he aims to sell 20 million electric vehicles in 2030 alone. According to consumer demand , the public agrees with Musk’s vision. Additionally, Musk has demonstrated that the space industry can be privatized, and for the better; his company SpaceX has seen the successful launch of rockets and their successful return back to Earth. It has succeeded in delivering supplies to the International Space Station. These show that privatization ventures may significantly reduce costs of space exploration."}

Also, while radio signals have been our go-to method for reaching out into interstellar territory, we’ve only had access to this technology for a relatively short amount of time . Radio travels at light-year speed; meaning, if we’ve been sending out signals for 100 years, only planets within 100 light-years of us would have been able to receive said signals. Just because we don’t yet know how to make contact with species outside of our own doesn’t mean they don’t exist."}

This is because it relies on blockchain technology , which is a complex mathematical model that instantly creates a virtual chain of recorded transactions when Bitcoin is transferred from one place to another. These transactions are easily verifiable, and will eliminate the possibility of human error, steep transaction fees, and long wait times when transferring money. In other words, Bitcoin makes the whole process of using money more efficient by cutting out the middlemen who have had to oversee every transaction that takes place thus far. This is why mainstream payment firms like PayPal are not only investing in it but offering it as an option to their platform."}

Indoor pot production has a massive carbon footprint . The electricity consumption of marijuana growhouses is significant. For example, one indoor growing facility can require as much lighting as operating rooms in hospitals , which, themselves, are 500 times greater than the recommended reading light levels. Denver’s indoor pot farms accounted for an estimated 4% of the city’s total electricity consumption in 2018. In total, cannabis production has been estimated to cost $6 billion in energy expenditures a year and predicted to hit $50 billion by 2026. As the globe’s second biggest producer of carbon emissions, the US should not support the rise of another industry with unsustainable energy demands."}

Additionally, after 9/11, Americans were afraid to fly even though driving to the airport is more dangerous.

While the US has an estimated 18,000 law enforcement agencies, only 7% have dedicated units to solve cold cases. This is where crowd-sleuthing can play a role. For instance, only one week after the US Capitol Building was infiltrated in 2021, FBI received tens of thousands of tips from people across the US in connection to the riot. In addition, e-sleuth hubs like the Doe Network continuously make headway on dozens of cold cases involving missing and unidentified persons.

Crime is expensive, costing taxpayers–and the government – tens of billions of dollars per year. Additionally, the amount of time and resources allocated to court trials takes away from time spent towards community productivity , and none of this takes into account the fact that crime is hurtful to its victims. As such, it doesn’t seem right that felons who have such an extensive negative impact on the social order should be allowed to be part of the decision-making process that contributes to that order. In violating the social contract by committing crime, felons are giving up their privilege of participating in the forming of societal policy."}

Yet, Britain has already lost influence in global security operations as a result of its post-Brexit separation from the EU’s CSDP (Common Security and Defense Policy).

He pointed out that the majority of what we experience and act upon are based on forces – emotions, memories, impulses – that we aren’t really aware of. Freud opened humanity’s eyes to the radical idea that most of what drives us is buried deep in our psyche.

For instance, some BLM activists have been accused of espousing anti-Semitic sentiments in the media and/or on social media, instead of speaking up for Black civil liberties. If the BLM were to embrace the #AllLivesMatter slogan, it would show that they care for all minorities, who would then be less cautious about embracing their cause."}

However (and with the utmost respect for the suffering of terror victims and their families), statistics reveal that losses of human life due to terror attacks are low in number . The 9/11 terror attacks killed 2,977 Americans . Since those attacks, 549 Americans have been killed in other terror attacks. In 2019, the most recent year that data is available, 51 people died in terrorist attacks in the US. That same year, around 20,000 people died from terror attacks globally – that’s an estimated 1 in 2000 deaths that year. For comparison, the odds of dying from heart disease or cancer are much higher: 1 in 6 . And from COVID-19? 1 in 10. In general, terrorists have no armies and minimal funding; terrorist activities are generally unable to make a destabilizing impact on target countries.

For example, female medics in Nad Ali came under fire just as much as the male medics with them. One of the medics, Sgt. Chanelle Taylor, was the first soldier to kill an enemy up close in Afghanistan, and she provided invaluable insight to her command team.

Meanwhile, cats make themselves scarce when the doorbell rings. Maybe, they’ll discreetly check out your guests by rubbing up against their leg , but there won’t be any overbearing leaping or leg humping. Plus, cats’ independence means you (and your guests) won’t need to give them constant attention. (That being said, cats’ independence should not be mistaken for cold aloofness.

The 20 percent rise in ADHD cases since the No Child Left Behind Act signals an important correlation between pressure for student achievement and increased diagnosis of the condition. The popular (but incorrect) perception that medicines used to treat ADHD enhance academic performance might also lead to parents to seek these treatments and educators to recommend them."}

Also, the constant state of fossil fuels’ molecular composition means they don’t form other compounds when stored in canisters for long periods.

(Think Fallout , Wednesday , The Mandalorian , Handmaid’s Tale or Black Mirro r.) In fact, 54.6% of respondents in a survey prefer binge-watching TV shows rather than watching episodes as they are released weekly. Today’s shows are now written with binge-watching in mind thanks to Netflix, Apple TV, Disney Plus, etc.; for example, Netflix’s Ozark and Stranger Things or Amazon Prime’s Fallout and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel , or Disney Plus’s Shogun to name just a few, release all of the episodes from a season at the same time, suggesting that the episodes are intended to be watched quickly and together.

Children (well, the little ones, at least) believe their parents know all and that their kisses have magical healing powers. And guess what – being admired makes parents want to be admirable. Parenting asks men and women to model the behavior they’d like to see in their children. Parents look both ways when crossing the street, eat their vegetables, and (attempt) to speak kindly to their partners. Children promote emotional growth by reminding their parents that life is not solely about them, and by shining a light on their parents’ weaknesses and therefore providing an opportunity to improve upon them."}

For example, some research may suggest that breastfeeding can stave off infections like ear infections, pneumonia, and diarrhea. However, readers must consider where such data is from. There’s a difference between studies that were conducted mainly in developing countries , where lack of clean water and other sanitation issues pose a real problem to safe bottle-feeding, and those studies done in Western, developed countries.

Now that people are living into their eighties, nineties and beyond, staying together “till death do us part” may be unrealistic. Humans are the only animals to practice monogamy as a lifestyle. And as the divorce rate for first-time marriages currently stands somewhere around 50%, one might begin to wonder whether humans were even made to be monogamous. The possibility that humans will be naturally compelled to explore the world and seek self-fulfillment just might make monogamy a pipe dream. If a couple is struggling to live together as a unit or remain monogamous, they should be able to part ways instead of suffering alongside each other for decades to come."}

The damage caused by extending sports games by a few minutes is relatively small compared to the damage when a game or even a season is decided over a bad call . Thus, implementing replays is the right thing to do."}

Yet, our ability to draw conclusions from said data (referred to as actionable insights) haven’t developed at the same accelerated speed. Therefore, an excessive amount of data can be just as confusing as having none at all. Nobel Laureate Ronald Coase said it best: “If you torture the data long enough, it will confess to anything.” Let’s also look at ad targeting, the most common use of data technology. While there are constant developments, our daily experiences may include instances that show that Big Data can still be limited. Like when your daughter may get a shaving cream ad because she happens to watch her cartoons on your YouTube account. Without the proper analytics, Big Data is less effective."}

The far-right expresses nostalgia for the past and actively works to preserve their history, regardless of what that might mean in today’s context. For right-wing Southerners, like the members of Save Southern Heritage , this means protecting statues of famous Confederates, and decrying the removal of the Confederate flag from public buildings or the removal of Confederate monuments. Conversely, the far-left (and in this case, many liberals) associates the past with its ills – slavery, sexism, and other injustices. History and its institutions are not to be preserved and cherished, but rather, an embarking point from which to begin reform."}

But even under close supervision, children can be exposed to such material on their own, especially on their or their friends’ smartphones ( TikTok , anyone?). While it’s true that there are many parent-control apps that filter and manage kids’ usage of smartphones, kids are smart, digital natives; they enjoy the challenge of coming up with new ways to bypass these measures .

Furthermore, unlike other social media platforms, Twitter has allowed your tweets to appear in Google search results since 2015. This means a lot of extra, perhaps unwelcome, exposure for any regrettably or hastily written or spoken sentiments. Take comedian Kevin Hart . He was scheduled to host the 2019 Academy Awards until his homophobic tweets were discovered and got him fired from the gig."}

The study shows that presence and productivity seem to be inextricably linked in the human psyche, even if there is no actual correlation between presence and output. (Most businesses rely on subjective reviews over performance data). Simply put, telecommuters are less likely to receive positive performance reviews or receive raises and promotions. Freelance telecommuters have the added challenge of establishing the brand recognition, visibility, and consumer trust that would allow for job promotion or the leverage to demand higher compensation. Furthermore, freelancers incur both time and monetary costs of professional development, making such endeavors less appealing, especially without the same guarantee of advancement that professional development offers in traditional employment."}

In fact, the new owner of the Miss Universe brand (its first-ever transgender female owner) says she wants to revamp it to uplift all women, including those from LGBTQ communities . Plus, many feel that these pageants embody feminism, which promotes women’s freedom and right to choose how to live their lives without being judged, including choosing to stand on stage and compete for a beauty pageant title. And what they do with their stage during and afterwards can be enlightening and empowering for other women. Look at former Miss America winner Camille Schrier , who did a science experiment on stage for her talent. She has now made science look cool and possible for girls and young women. Also, Miss Pennsylvania 2016, Valerie Gatto, self-identified on stage as a “ product of rape ” and has since used her title to educate others on sexual assault. Miss World 1998, Linot Abargil , also shed the world’s spotlight on rape.

Teaching about the Holocaust is important to make students aware that under the “right” circumstances, anyone can get caught up in allowing violent crimes to be committed or even committing them themselves for what are perceived as the right reasons. The relevance of this Holocaust lesson was demonstrated by the post-Holocaust Milgram experiments . Participants were brought into a lab and told to administer electric shocks to a person in another room, should that person answer questions from a “memory test” incorrectly. Sixty-five percent of the participants continued to give shocks up to the highest, deadly level of 450 volts because the head of the experiment told them to keep going. In other words, these experiments showed how humans are conditioned to obey authority , to the extent that they would kill another person if told to do so. The Holocaust is a crucial, illustrative lesson on how almost anyone can be engulfed in and justify violent racism; this lesson must be taught to impressionable schoolchildren to prevent it from happening again."}

The show’s writing and production teams turned a simple premise into one of the most successful shows ever produced as it was relatable on many levels; audiences could see themselves in the main characters as they navigated their path into adulthood. (It was also fun to aspire to Monica, Rachel and Phoebe ’s beauty and style, Joey’s coolness, Chandler’s wit and Ross’s sweetness.) Sure, many aspects were unrealistic (whose NY apartment is as big as Monica’s?), but issues of dating, connecting and falling out with friends, job stress, the fears of becoming independent and settling down, etc. are all universally familiar. And the producers tackled all of these subjects candidly, with light, topical humor and clever dialogue that never offended viewers. Plus, the cast’s genuine rapport and excellent comedic timing made the show an enduring – and endearing – legacy. It is the quintessential classic sitcom, which is why it remains so popular today."}

Countries like Japan , who have no apparent desire to develop nuclear weapons, nevertheless hang onto stockpiles of plutonium and uranium . Doing so would make it exceedingly easy for them to develop nuclear weapons and set a precedent for other countries to follow. The international “on your honor policies” that govern civil use of nuclear power provide little comfort or security when one considers the volatile countries like Iran , Pakistan and North Korea, which have acquired weapons despite these policies. And let’s not forget India and Pakistan’s increasingly heated tensions over Kashmir. Nuclear energy has the potential to enable its owners to dramatically alter the world order, a worrying prospect for governments and individuals alike."}

In an attempt to free American hostages held by Lebanese terrorists and to support Nicaraguan Contras, Reagan’s administration covertly sold weapons to Iran and funneled the proceeds to the Latin American rebels. The former was both illegal – there was an embargo against shipping arms to Iran – and a violation of his campaign pledge not to negotiate with terrorists. The latter violated a Congressional ban against operations in Nicaragua. The operation was a failure; while three hostages were released, three more were soon abducted. When the operation came to light, it badly damaged Reagan’s reputation and led to charges against 14 people in the administration, including Oliver North ."}

Star Trek debuted in 1966, just five years after Yuri Gagarin was the first man to journey into outer space and two years before the moon landing. At that time in history, the race to space was as real as it gets.

Additionally, in some cases, individual worker effectiveness can become somewhat irrelevant under unions, because their contracts may limit the amount an employee can advance within a company. As a result, some unionized employees may not be motivated to work hard – yet they are protected by their union from losing their job. By the same token, employees that want to excel find it difficult to do so in an environment that places importance on seniority rather than merit. It’s hard enough for businesses to thrive without the added headaches of unmotivated workers and restricted competitive advantage, but union interference can make company success a much more difficult outcome."}
{"id": 205, "content": "Surrealist memes find cultural forbears in the pre-internet art movements of Dadaism, Surrealism and Pop Art. Surrealist memes approach the absurdity of contemporary life in the same manner as Dadaism , which contended that art doesn’t need to make sense if governments and societies don’t make sense either. Surreal memes incorporate Surrealist and Dada styles, utilizing Salvador Dali-inspired meme bases, and montages that are reminiscent of collage techniques popularized by the Dada movement. The medium by which most memes are produced, with image macros that lays text over premade images, speaks to mass manufacturing, a focal point of the Pop Art movement. By referencing Dali in the same image as Pepe the Frog, surreal memes accomplish another central goal of Pop Art – to mix high and low culture and elevate ordinary, daily items into the world of fine art. This ongoing dialogue between various art movements and surreal memes points to the latter’s power as a driving force in the progression of meme art."}

Meanwhile, several US banks and many companies had decided to move jobs out of London and into the EU. In early 2017, the Pound fell to a 10-week low in part due to these reasons, and, although it bounced back against the dollar, it remains to be seen what will happen post-Brexit , especially compared to the euro.

Poland also swayed far-right and prevented refugees from coming in . In 2016, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of Poland’s ruling Law and Justice Party, said that the country wouldn’t accept refugees “because there is no mechanism that would ensure safety.” That fear-driven anti-immigrant sentiment is still upheld today. European countries point at terror attack s committed in Germany , France and Austria by refugees as examples of a failed attempt at multiculturalism.

While imports from Mexico represent around 13 percent of total US imports, approximately 82 percent of Mexico’s exports are destined for the US market. This has helped Mexico more than quadruple its exports as a share of GDP in the two decades since NAFTA. Also, increased contact with the developed American and Canadian economies gave Mexico a more open society , leading to significant reforms."}

Decades-long studies have shown that this fear was unfounded. Adopted children who interact with their birth families feel integrated into their adoptive families and regard their adoptive parents as their mother and father. In some cases, the possibility of forming some kind of relationship with their birth family may create a sense of an “extended family” and, thus, mitigates adoptees’ yearning to search for their roots. Whereas closed adoptions have been shown to promote birth-family fantasies in children and adolescents, an adoptee’s interaction with biological family helps the placed child develop a realistic idea of their birth family, and thereby form a more authentic and positive self-identity as an adopted person"}

For commercial science enterprises, non-animal experiments have the dual benefit of cost efficiencies and less regulation. It stands to reason that the more the public nudges researchers toward alternative testing measures, the more encouraged they’ll be to find them."}

With free access to US markets, firms would pay less for Mexican labor south of the border. A year later, in 1993, President Clinton signed NAFTA into law. And more than 20 years later, Perot’s prediction has been validated. The US trade deficit with Mexico stood at $63 billion in 2016 while US manufacturing has seen a rapid decline; from 2000 to 2010 the country lost more than 600,000 manufacturing jobs, as companies moved to Mexico rather than paying higher wages to American workers. The new NAFTA agreement aims to bring manufacturing jobs back to America, among other strategies that will make the country and its neighbors more competitive in the global marketplace."}

Snowden’s decision to share this information consequently prompted a global debate over surveillance techniques and protecting citizens’ privacy . This, in turn, resulted in the US government passing laws for the first time in decades restricting government surveillance.

According to two psychological surveys, people suffering from torture produce unreliable information , and the most effective way to get them to tell the truth is through building rapport. In fact, the US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence published a report on the CIA’s detention and interrogation program.

Jealousy has biological roots , with sexual jealousy and emotional jealousy being the two most vicious contenders.

In fact, studies show that sexual jealousy is one of the most important human emotions. While there may be a small percentage of people who are able to overcome their jealousy and live happily in open relationships, most have a hard time sharing their loved ones with multiple partners. The fact that this feeling is instinctual shows that monogamy may likely be the natural choice."}

If the military is looking for the creme de la creme to serve in their units, then why give up on 51% of the candidates upfront? In Israel, women not only serve in combat units but lead them, too. India has also jumped on the equality bandwagon; its Supreme Court recently passed a ruling allowing women to serve as army commanders. The army mirrors society, and having exceptional women in the army is crucial to the way we want to see society. Any concern about having women in combat units stems from broader attitudes toward gender norms; these can’t begin to be addressed unless change starts at the core: The military."}

But BMI does not measure body fat directly, and as such, people who are not obese according to their body fat percentage are deemed obese with the BMI diagnostic. By this definition, fitness fanatics like Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) and the lion’s share of NFL athletes are technically “obese.” Worse, BMI is not an effective prognosticator of metabolic wellness; one study found that approximately one in four people with normal BMIs nevertheless had some kind of metabolic dysfunction.

The government does a poor job of weaning the needy off of welfare and teaching them how to enhance their employability or earning potential. Not to mention that high marginal tax rates come into play when a household’s income increases. The minute a family attempts to cross back over the poverty line, these tax rates are combined with benefit phase-outs, resulting in a loss of 50-60% of the family’s initial income gain.

He declared himself as the greatest boxer (when he was still Cassius Clay), and was quoted numerous times saying how good, beautiful and talented he was.

They are known to be catalysts of social trends and movements. Just look at US Women’s Soccer team co-captain, Megan Rapinoe , who led the group fight for equal pay, among Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles , and many others. As long as we agree with this prejudice casting , we take part in reinforcing it. Our society must not put up with it anymore.

Scriptures gave us rules that addressed the times in which they were written. The Bible declares stoning as the punishment for planting two different crops side by side but says nothing about cyberbullying. While their key values are timeless, most religions are based on texts that don’t address our modern lives and dilemmas, at least not without significant interpretation.

Long before the WHO’s announcement, both Pepsi and Coca-Cola had been embarking on different paths to remain relevant and competitive in the long term. Coca-Cola has been transitioning into a “ total beverage company ,” partnering over the last few years with various brands of bottled waters, teas , premium milk and even canned alcoholic drinks in Japan . Meanwhile, Pepsi has jumped on the nutrition bandwagon, ditching aspartame from its diet beverages back in 2015 and later expanding its portfolio of snack foods to include “ guilt-free products ” that contain grains, fruits, vegetables or protein as well as healthy drinks . (That being said, it also introduced a limited edition Pepsi Apple Pie flavor .)"}

Personal legacies keep people alive long after their physical bodies deteriorate. Headstones, stories, newspaper clippings, diaries, videos and photographs are all ways we preserve the lives of those who have perished. Cultures around the world also offer a myriad ways of keeping the dead alive: Mexico’s Day of the Dead has been around for centuries, and it celebrates the lives of those who have passed (and was featured in the film Coco ); the Egyptian Book of the Dead – a personalized book of spells that helps souls navigate death – has existed for thousands of years; Korea’s three-day harvest festival, Chuseok , is celebrated by honoring the memories (and gravestones) of ancestors. We may stop moving and breathing at some point, but legacies never die, thus, there is life after death."}

Decriminalization allows sex workers to call the police in incidences of violence. In the Netherlands , decriminalizing prostitution gave sex workers access to social security and public health care. India’s union of sex workers improved prostitutes’ financial security by teaching them how to identify counterfeit bills . Sexually transmitted infections are also statistically lower in areas where prostitution is decriminalized. In rural Nevada, where prostitution is legal (and condoms and regular HIV tests mandatory), there has not been one case of HIV/AIDS diagnosed in a registered sex worker since 1986 . Beyond all the practical benefits, legalizing prostitution brings sex workers into the fold of society, increasing their sense of belonging, and thereby enhancing their feelings of responsibility toward others."}

For instance, the average American dress size – 14 – is actually branded in the UK and Australia as 16. By switching the labels, companies are pandering to our “beauty standard” driven egos rather than to our “health risk” reality. In contrast, in Japan, the government implemented a healthcare system that requires healthcare providers to measure the waist size of citizens between ages 45 and 74 as part of their annual checkups. This system recognizes that just like smoking, we are responsible for what we put in our bodies. There is no trend or stigma attached there; it is a health issue plain and simple.

Whitewashing has a long history in American film, from Mickey Rooney’s Japanese caricature, Mr. Yunioshi, in Breakfast at Tiffany’s to Jonny Depp’s take on Tonto , John Wayne’s Native American sidekick. Whitewashing takes more forms than just appointing white actors to roles written for non-white characters. In films based on true stories, the story’s real-life inspiration, if an ethnic minority, is often portrayed as white onscreen. Ben Affleck’s Argo completely erased protagonist Antonio Mendez’s Chicano heritage.

Having survived both bullying and emotional abuse, he still managed to code and sell his first video game at 12 years old, and his creativity hasn’t stopped since. His failures were many before his success – though the failures don’t seem to end. Most recently, Musk decided to walk away from the $44 billion Twitter deal despite the legal and reputational risks. Previously, Musk was removed from his CEO position at t wo of his own companies , survived malaria, and oversaw three failed launches after the creation of SpaceX (which left the company almost bankrupt). In 2018, he settled with the SEC after being accused of misleading investors and agreed to step down as Tesla chairman, pay a $20 million fine but to remain as CEO. That same year, a Los Angeles court found Musk not guilty of defamation after he made a series of Tweets, calling a British diver who was part of the life-saving efforts of a Thai youth soccer team a pedophile after the diver rejected Musk’s offer of a submarine. No matter how wealthy, brilliant (or, at times, petulant ), Musk’s experiences with hardship and failure make him relatable to the common man."}

For example, in the movie Freedom Writers (which is based on a true story), a high school teacher uses the Holocaust to teach lessons about tolerance to at-risk youth who had been engaged in race wars. Teaching children or teenagers about the Holocaust can provide them with concrete examples of the detrimental effects of bullying and racism. Additionally, discussing such topics helps students develop their own critical thinking about morality and how they can spread tolerance in the world. Today, when anti-Semitism is not only on the rise but getting more mainstream , it is all the more important to teach teenagers about the dangers of anti-Semitism in the hopes of preventing more hate crimes targeted at Jews from occurring."}

This is because there was once a proto-chicken – a bird resembling a chicken, but not quite of chicken status – that went about its business laying and fertilizing an egg. However, this egg carried some sort of genetic mutation that turned it into the chicken we have now come to know and love. Because the parents of the first chicken egg were birds that weren’t yet chickens, it appears that the egg did, indeed, come first. In addition, eggs of other birds predated chickens by millions of years, and there are fossils to prove it. The Archaeopteryx – largely accepted as the world’s oldest and first bird , and the closest living being of ancient times to resemble a chicken – left behind fossils from 150 million years ago, give or take. So, in comparison to other types of birds, chickens came rather late to the evolutionary party."}

{"id": 251, "content": "Traditional marketing was thought of as an operation that only takes effect once the product was ready to launch. In contrast, digital marketing (or more specifically product marketing) is thought of as part of an ongoing process in which feedback is collected and product improvements are made continuously. Through marketing data (i.e., how many people have reacted to a specific message or product), customers get to influence the products they consume. This integration of marketing into the company’s core business is key to the rise of many online giants. For companies like Booking.com, the optimization of marketing reach is what determines their revenue. The publishing industry’s revenue is comprised of the gap between the cost of acquiring a user and the money that can be made during their stay on a website (ads, subscription, etc.). There is a whole subset of businesses that drive traffic to other sites for a portion of revenue. Their whole operation is nothing but online marketing. Digital marketing also opened up new opportunities for small and medium business, where traditional marketing offered very few options for a local business. Digital marketing enhances the voice and precision of any interested individual for any budget and with minimal know-how."}

For the first time in history, a federal court wet its feet in the gerrymandering issue and ruled the state’s redistricting plan unconstitutional, in that it unduly favored one party over another.

Moreover, distinguishing anatomical features , such as greater physical strength, could well be adaptations for inter-male fighting. But does this mean that men evolved to be violent?

As imperfect as the US health system is, American patients rarely see wait times approaching this length. Too often, these delays can mean the difference between life and death.

The Paris climate change agreement is now as good as gone , as is the order that allowed transgender troops to serve in the military.

Many elementary students also feel that their homework is just “busy work” or that the teacher “has” to assign it, so they don’t take it seriously . Even worse is when homework is beyond a child’s ability and becomes work for the parents .

{"id": 279, "content": "Forcing a small slice of Americans to bear an inordinate burden of funding the government is not just immoral but also counterproductive ; it kills jobs, and sometimes even results in lower government revenue. Raising taxes on the rich creates a disincentive for work and job creation, slowing down both. If higher taxes discourage a business from opening or expanding, it is not just the rich who suffer but also the workers who are not hired. Further, this means that tax hikes often do not have the intended effect of raising revenue. If high taxes slow down economic growth, the government ends up taxing a smaller amount of money at a higher rate. Sometimes, this means a tax hike actually leads to lower total revenues, but even in less extreme cases, tax hikes yield diminishing returns ."}

The fundamental weakness of the Soviet economy and Mikhail Gorbachev’s leadership played a much greater role – Reagan was simply in office at the right time. Reagan’s actual foreign policy decisions brought about undesirable consequences. His military buildup led to huge deficits. His support for Nicaraguan Contras undermined that country’s democracy and stability (and led to the Iran-Contra scandal, detailed below). His intervention in Afghanistan helped pave the way for the Taliban and al Qaeda. And his invasion of the tiny Caribbean island of Grenada, which included a mistaken bombing of a mental hospital , irked even US allies ."}
{"id": 281, "content": "The burglars caught and arrested for wiretapping phones and stealing documents in the Democratic National Committee (DNC) office in the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C., were solely and directly connected to President Nixon’s Republican reelection campaign. It was later revealed that Nixon, himself, took aggressive steps to subsequently cover up the criminal robbery and other related illegal activities. Watergate was an entirely domestic affair. In contrast, U.S. intelligence officials confirmed that there was a massive effort by the Russians to intervene in the 2016 presidential election through cyberwarfare. (While Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report did not find evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia’s election meddling , it did not fully exonerate Trump of obstruction of justice during the Justice Department’s subsequent investigations into the matter.) While questions still remain, which the newly released Mueller report may finally answer, what is known for sure is that a foreign power – in fact, to a large extent, a hostile foreign power – did interfere with US domestic issues for its own purposes."}
{"id": 282, "content": "Sean Connery’s mastery of witty dialogue has made his Bond the coolest and most collected of all. Due to the lack of cinematic technologies during the 60s and early 70s, Connery’s Bond films had to rely on more dialogue scenes than today’s explosion-packed Bond installments. He uses his wit and charm to great effect, whether trying to get out of tough situations or to connect with other characters. This brings another plot layer to the franchise for viewers to appreciate instead of just multiple fight scenes to move the plot forward. Connery’s perfectly timed delivery of clever dialogue makes his Bond more amusing for viewers than his successors. Such one liners like “shocking,” said after he kills an enemy by electrocution in Goldfinger, are what make Connery’s James Bond the most memorable."}

A study found that welfare recipients are deprived of positive feelings of self-worth after receiving handouts – feelings that are necessary to function in society at full capacity; lack of self-esteem contributes to a lack of motivation and a diminished desire to move up in life. Research from a Yale University study corroborates these findings. Even former President Obama – a staunch advocate for social benefits – cited his own anecdotal evidence of welfare programs encouraging this culture of dependency and reducing motivation in their recipients."}

Unpaid interns tend to feel that their work is unimportant because they aren’t being paid for it, consequently leading some to expend only a meager effort. This doesn’t establish long-term loyalty. Businesses, then have to train someone with no loyalty to the company who could leave at any time. Meanwhile, paid interns feel more engaged with the company and more enthusiastic to give their all to the job."}

This is especially true when both artist and victim are still alive. Woody Allen’s daughter Dylan, who claims that Allen molested her , wrote an open letter expressing her pain that Allen was honored by people who know what he did to her. Let’s also remember that, besides the victor in Bill Cosby’s retrial, other women had separately accused him of sexual assault . Though on a much different scale than Cosby, comedian Louis C.K. also has a list of victims he exposed to sexual harassment, who deserve consideration before society welcomes his comeback attempts . So, watching a TV show, or paying to watch a movie, enter an exhibition or download a song inevitably means giving certain artists money and recognition that they don’t deserve."}
{"id": 286, "content": "Celebrity sex tapes have been a staple of Hollywood scandal since the personal camcorder became popular in the 1980s. Invariably, most of these intimate videos or private nude pictures were stolen and released without the stars’ consent, and are brazen invasions of privacy. But careers are rarely ruined by sex tapes or other personal or legal scandals. Martha Stewart remained as popular as ever following a 5-month jail sentence for insider trading ; Hugh Grant is still king of the romantic comedy even after cheating on Elizabeth Hurley with a prostitute. While the MeToo movement changed the landscape for the likes of Harry Weinstein and other celebrities who got away with systematic sexual harassment and abuse, not everything has changed. Actors accused of domestic violence, like Johnny Depp , or actresses who have broken the law in other ways, like Felicity Huffman , may not retain their titles as Hollywood’s popular leading men and women, but they haven’t disappeared altogether. Indeed, the public airing of dirty laundry seems to endear the public more than it repels them."}
{"id": 287, "content": "In a society that pushes for body acceptance and self-love, beauty pageants cultivate the exact opposite ideals. For instance, in the 1930s, when beauty pageants were in full swing, the average Body Mass Index ( BMI ) of a contestant was 20.8, which is mid-range of a healthy BMI. However, in 2010, the average BMI of a contestant dropped to 18.9, which is low and therefore runs the risk of an unhealthy contestant. Coupled with statistics that 26% of surveyed contestants have reported being perceived to have an eating disorder, 48.5% have reported wanting to be thinner and 6% of contestants have reported having depression, beauty pageants can be viewed as feeding insecurities and real health risks for contestants. The pressure to attain and maintain such unrealistic body standards is also dangerous for non-contestants, as there is a clear disconnect between the BMI of the average viewer and that of contestants, whom they try but fail to emulate."}

They depict unqualified “brokers” using high-pressure sales tactics to convince unsuspecting civilians to invest with them, usually by giving them false information about various stocks. The brokers become millionaires, and the people who invest with them often lose their money. Unfortunately, these movies aren’t works of imaginative fiction; The W olf of Wall Street is based on a true story , and there are many examples of real-life corruption among Wall Street’s banks. For instance, JPMorgan Chase paid $410 million in penalties for manipulating electricity markets in California in 2013. Additionally, that same year, $5.6 billion was paid by six major banks in response to allegations that their investment banking traders tried to manipulate foreign exchange rates. More recently, in December 2019, Goldman Sachs began talks with the US government about a possible $2 billion settlement and a potential admission of guilt over their alleged role in a Malaysian corruption scandal."}

Additionally, the 1989 San Francisco 49ers were one of the few teams to win two consecutive championships, with an impressive 55-10 win against a Denver Broncos (which was quarterbacked by a future Hall-of-Famer) in Super Bowl 1989. And there is more: Much like the 1991 Redskins, the 1989 San Francisco 49ers lost only two games by a total of five points. Their offense, led by Montana and the legendary wide receiver Jerry Rice , was exhilarating, finishing first in the NFL in scoring (27.6 points per game)."}

Even if viewers get to see both versions with fresh eyes, the movie story is simply richer . It has more action scenes that aren’t in the stage version. There are easter eggs that cleverly appear throughout the movie (like the images on Doc’s walls when the movie begins) which are missing in the musical, and there is no Einstein in the musical. The story was originally written for film and not for the stage, with an expansive canvas in mind, and this is where it works better. It’s understandable, then, that changes had to be made to the story for the stage adaptation but they also take away from some of the depth of the original story."}

If these results were to be reproduced in more environments, the Montessori method could prove to offer meaningful advantage over other traditional or alternative methods. More recent research compared the wellbeing of adults who had gone to Montessori school during childhood and those who went to conventional schools; the wellbeing surveys of the Montessori graduates showed strong evidence of elevated psychological wellbeing as adults."}

And more than 20 years later, Perot’s prediction has been validated. The US trade deficit with Mexico stood at $63 billion in 2016 while US manufacturing has seen a rapid decline; from 2000 to 2010 the country lost more than 600,000 manufacturing jobs, as companies moved to Mexico rather than paying higher wages to American workers. The new NAFTA agreement aims to bring manufacturing jobs back to America, among other strategies that will make the country and its neighbors more competitive in the global marketplace."}

There are no substitutions, no “weak” moments when the game is played elsewhere or when a teammate takes over control of the game.

The 1996 draft had far more weaker links, especially compared to Barkley or Stockton. Steve Nash was considered as a lesser version of Stockton, and a far worse defensive player. Allen Iverson is considered one of the most talented players ever, but he never fulfilled his potential. Kobe Bryant was a phenomenon, but if you consider players like Markus Camby, Shareef Abdur-Rahim, or Stephon Marbury of the 1996 draft, this one had weaker links."}

Yet, while intervention has its drawbacks and complications, failing to act often carries an even steeper price. Avoiding confrontation sometimes puts American citizens at risk. President Clinton had the chance to kill Osama bin Laden several times but did not pull the trigger. A strike that killed al-Qaeda’s leader but resulted in civilian casualties may have earned criticism – indeed, it may have ended up in the other half of this column – but it could have prevented the 3,000 lives lost on 9/11 and avoided a long, protracted war in Afghanistan. Then, there are the humanitarian costs of inaction. Clinton called his failure to stop the genocide in Rwanda, where 800,000 people were killed in just two months, one of his biggest regrets .

In fact, before the pandemic, states like New York proposed to increase the weight of this tool on evaluating teacher performance to 50%. Such a system that punishes and rewards teachers based on test scores won’t contribute to better education for students."}

In fact, some of the rioters who stormed the US Capitol building in 2021 were fired from their jobs after internet-sleuths found them online and publicized their identities . Casual social media users have long used social media as a tool to offer police agencies tips based on posts that allude to – or brag about – criminal activity.

Bush’s first year in office, it was President Reagan’s strong foreign policy and tough stance towards the Soviet Union that helped the US win the Cold War. Upon taking office, Reagan launched a military buildup aimed at reassuring the country’s allies , forcing the USSR to the negotiating table, and ensuring that the US could prevail in the event of war. Defense spending rose from 5.5 percent of GDP in 1979 to 6.8 percent in 1986. Reagan also recommitted the US to stopping the spread of Soviet-style Marxism around the globe . In Afghanistan, he upped his predecessor’s support for anti-Soviet forces, leading the USSR to flee. At the same time, he was restrained in the use of military force. While many of Reagan’s actions – including his Strategic Defense Initiative, a missile defense system dubbed “Star Wars” by critics – were mocked at the time, Reagan had the last laugh. His commitment to “peace through strength” was vindicated with the collapse of the Soviet Union."}

The two-decade-long Afghanistan war alone cost an estimated $300M a day . Though the US is capable of defeating any enemy, the cost of doing so in both human lives and money is usually far greater than anticipated. Wars like Iraq, Afghanistan and Vietnam , the latter of which saw nearly 60,000 American soldiers killed, are a case in point. But even smaller-scale interventions, like President Clinton’s 1993 mission in Somalia or the overthrow of Libyan dictator Moammar Gaddafi in 2011, had unintended consequences .

It’s fairly evident that the answer is no. The First Amendment is not about speech, it is meant to ensure that those inhabiting America are safe and can express themselves as they see fit, which the Biden administration is advocating through its United We Stand Summit , which aims to work toward preventing and/or countering the effects of hate-fueled violence in society.

And while 84% of all shoppers have made impulse buys at one point or another, it may be easier to do so on Amazon since it invests heavily in exposing shoppers to new products at every step of their Amazon experience – from first opening the homepage all the way through checkout.

In the summer of 2014, after being accused of mishandling the infamous Ray Rice incident, in which the Baltimore Ravens player was caught on video beating his then-fiancé, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced a new league policy to punish any player involved in domestic violence or sexual assault with a six-game suspension without pay. However, it was inconsistently reinforced, and even updated in 2016 with more loopholes. Since then, the NFL appears to have softened its stance, enforcing the six-game suspension against only two of 18 players publicly linked to domestic violence allegations. In response to its inconsistent and flippant attitude toward stemming domestic violence, fans ( 24% of those surveyed) are abandoning the NFL."}
{"id": 324, "content": "Having a baby is a rigorous experience that takes its toll on women’s physical and mental health. Paid maternity leave would allow these women the time needed to heal, or at least start healing. However, many women who have to return to work just a few days or weeks after giving birth have to lift heavy items and/or stand for long periods of time, even though this could be dangerous for their ongoing health. Even the increasing numbers of women who give birth by C-section often need to return to work before the recommended period of convalescence. Paid maternity leave has been found to lower the risks of post-partum depression. Being forced back to work by fear of losing their jobs or the financial pressure of living on one paycheck can seriously impact women’s health for years after giving birth.

Critics argue that his ideas, particularly those related to sexuality, psychosexual stages of development, and gender – specifically the female identity – are outdated and reflect the biases of his era. His theories, like women’s “rape fantasy,” were developed during a time when societal attitudes towards sexuality – and femininity in general – were much more conservative (or downright sexist ), which may have influenced his views on the subject. After all, back then, femininity only existed in direct relation to masculinity, and women were viewed as feeling morally inferior to men (hence, they suffered from “ penis envy “), issues that Freud claimed could never be solved."}

Per game, Bird scored 24.3 points, picked 10 rebounds, and delivered 6.3 assists. In comparison, Magic`s stats are 19.5, 7.2 and 11.2, respectively. However, Magic’s playoff stats are better. During the playoffs, while Bird scored 0.5 less points per game, Magic delivered one more assist and picked 0.5 more rebounds per game. Meaning, Magic always performed better during playoff time, when the money was on the table, as proven in game 6 of his rookie season. This is why he has two more championships over Bird."}

But it’s not just America; democracy all over the world seems to be in decline . However, within America, even attacks on the US Capital couldn’t weaken the country’s democratic and Constitutional principles. American democracy does not only speak to political realities but to cultural ones as well. America excels at incorporating disparate voices and interests into its varied fabric; the far left, far right, and everyone in between have equal protections for expression and assembly, protections which are by no means guaranteed in other countries ."}

Efforts to curb explosive growth – such as the one-child policy , which had been in place for over 30 years – have backfired, resulting in an aging population that’s predominantly male . Much of China’s youth has gone abroad to seek opportunity, and China’s labor force is shrinking as a result. While their middle class may be growing rapidly, the income inequality outside of big cities is rampant by unparalleled standards. Until China’s demographics are adjusted to reflect a more balanced society across age, genders and socioeconomic status, their rise to superpower status is likely to be nonexistent."}

Agricultural workers were once worried that the tractor would render field workers inefficient and irrelevant. It did, but the world was not ravaged by unemployment – agricultural workers merely ended up contributing their labor to innumerable other industries . Similarly, the ATM, feared as the death knell of bank work, ended up generating hordes of new jobs related to ATMs. The internet and e-commerce may eradicate some kinds of work but will ultimately advance humanity toward new professional and economic opportunities.

In ancient times, people lacked the knowledge to explain natural phenomena and so they would make up stories to make sense of the world. As such, illness was recounted as punishments for wrongful acts, and natural disasters served were interpreted as heavenly omens. The flood described in the Bible story of Noah’s Ark can be understood as an especially massive flood in the Black Sea basin roughly some 8,000 years ago. The locusts’ outburst in the Bible’s Ten Plagues story can be explained in scientific terms.

This indicates that the stories were passed down relatively accurately . Many Bible stories appear similarly, if not identically, in the books of the different monotheistic religions. The more texts that are collected that tell the same storyline, the greater and stronger their historical accuracy is believed to be.

When a #BlueLivesMatter hashtag was added to support policemen, it was used to oppose #BlackLivesMatter.” This was further shown in 2016 when 10,000 people protested in support Peter Liang, a Chinese-American policeman who was jailed for killing Akai Gurley, an unarmed Black man. Many of Liang’s supporters shouted, “All Lives Matter,” claiming that he was a scapegoat because he was not white and that he should not be jailed. However, Black activists pointed out that Liang was tried by a jury of his peers and deserved to be jailed for his actions. Using “All Lives Matter” to demand freedom for someone who was convicted of murdering an unarmed Black man is nothing more than demanding that white privilege be extended to all people of color except for Black Americans."}

Ergo, pushing women to breastfeed is tantamount to pushing them into the home. The seriousness with which a mother is to approach her occupation as food source is echoed in lactivist Dr. Sear’s sentiment that, through the breastfeeding process, mothers (not parents, mind you) must learn to be “ child-centered .” Pressure to breastfeed sends a clear message: Mothers are secondary to their children, and being a woman (with dreams and ambitions and all that good stuff) is secondary to being a mother.

In becoming a U.S. state, Puerto Ricans could enjoy both the benefits associated with statehood and the tools needed to develop their own industry and workforce on the island. Statehood would increase local job opportunities , bring about income creation benefits and enable locals to receive better health care, which they are already paying for, but do not currently benefit from.

But even before the Watergate break-in, Democratic opposition to Nixon was already submitting a resolution for his impeachment. Meanwhile, President Trump had overwhelming support from a Republican Congress after his election. (And even after the 2018 mid-terms , though Democrats took the House of Representatives, Republicans increased their majority in the Senate.) While there were GOP-controlled Senate and House intelligence committees investigating Trump-Russia links at the beginning of this saga, there was little headway due to missteps and lack of urgency from most Republicans to exert extra pressure on resolving the situation. This culminated in a then-Republican-led House intelligence committee clearing Trump and his campaign of suspected Russia collusion. Unlike the calls for impeachment surrounding Nixon, today’s Senate is still, overall, on Trump’s side . Before the release of the Mueller report, Democrats were squashing talks of impeachment.

It’s also been said that he have burned or destroyed many of papers and case notes over the years, so proof is elusive. In addition, it’s known that Freud didn’t welcome criticism or discussion. For example, Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung was banished from professional circles after he dared to question Freud, who saw himself as the only authority on psychoanalysis, thereby limiting what could have led to expanded discussion and discoveries of other thought leaders of the time. These examples have led some professionals over the years to consider him overrated in terms of scientific validity."}

It’s not surprising, then, that the soda industry has spent at least $107 million at state and local levels over the past decade fighting soda taxes.

After all, most common women don’t come from a privileged upbringing whose family has tens of millions of dollars of wealth. Additionally, Paltrow’s participation in the 2015 SNAP challenge against food hunger could have been inspiring, but instead she was patronizing when she bought six limes with her allotted $29-a-week budget. By doing so, Paltrow showed that she had very little in common with the common woman at all.

As art journalist Jonathan Jones points out, distinguished artists like Mark Rothko and Nobel prize-winner Bob Dylan took pains to avoid meaning of any kind being attached to their work. Jones opines, “The most deadening influence on art in our time is the belief that content matters more than style.” Surreal memes evade easy understanding or categorization.

Even for those workers who did not lose their jobs, the threat of competition from Mexico lowered wages for Americans in industries such as textile, apparel, and automotive manufacturing. Some business owners and managers do not have to move to Mexico to save on labor costs – they simply must threaten to do so . During collective bargaining, managers can say that they will move their plants south if workers do not meet their terms, and employees can hardly afford to call their bluff. Similarly, this discouraged unionization, a boon for corporations but not for their employees. However, the new NAFTA deal is likely to be beneficial for trade unions . NAFTA is not the only reason wages have been stagnant ever since its signing, but it certainly has not helped.

Take, for example, her Anaconda album cover , which blatantly uses her body and the idea of sex to sell her music and brand. While making money certainly isn’t anti-feminist, the way Minaj chooses to objectify her body to make money is a damaging example to set for other women. Plus (not doubting her personal honesty, but examining her public persona), her confident view of her body seems insincere, if not downright artificial. The poses, the clothes and her movements all seem to go much more naturally with a male-oriented sexual fantasy world, and fit corporate and cultural conditioning."}

While the country intervened in other small ways overseas, this never led to full-on war the likes of which is successors saw. Clinton was a president that preferred negotiation to intervention. In fact, he got incredibly close to brokering a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine. Clinton also managed to negotiate with North Korea – his Agreed Framework of 1994 kept nuclear weapons out of their hands for eight years."}

Sure, potential contestants are lured in with promises of earning money from sponsors, scholarships and prizes, but between entry fees ($300-$500), gowns ($500-$5000) and coaching (upwards from $100 an hour), the money invested in competing professionally could perhaps be better used to expand contestants’ educational opportunities and improve their current living situations. There’s also the risk of falling victim to beauty pageant scams. The Better Business Bureau has received over 10,000 inquiries over the years, chasing false advertising from Beauty Pageants."}

This can lead to negative self-esteem, envy, and unrealistic standards of success. Musk plays his own part in this comparison, creating the perception that he’s the sole embodiment of technological prowess. Yet, it’s easy to forget that, in reality, Musk wouldn’t have been able to get where he is without government funding , subsidies for electric cars, etc. Furthermore, Musk’s elevation by the public to a capitalist idol “has distorted the flow of capital and talent. Healthy markets don’t take cues from the tweets of one man,” writes American author and business professor Scott Galloway . For example, Musk’s outsized influence on raising (or lowering, in the case of Dogecoin ) the value, popularity and production of cryptocurrency has masked the truth that the high level of carbon emissions from increased mining of Bitcoin significantly reduces if not wipes out any carbon savings of Teslas."}

Jeter’s 3,465 hits are the most ever by a shortstop, and sixth most of any player at any position. He also leads all shortstops in runs ( Alex Rodriguez has him narrowly beat in this category but played less than half his games at the position), while his .310 career batting average is 35 points higher than Cal Ripken Jr. and Ernie Banks, two top contenders for the honor. Jeter is not known as a power hitter, and he certainly never threatened either of Barry Bonds’ home run records. But his 260 career home runs are more than all but two Hall of Fame shortstops (Banks and Ripken), and they blow away Honus Wagner’s 101. Though he never won an MVP award for a regular season, he finished in the top 10 in voting eight times (and in the top three spots thrice)."}

With the legalization of marijuana use, the prevalence of marijuana-related illnesses may grow with the number of people who use it. For example, following legalization, Colorado health professionals noted a surge in cases of extreme illness in children who ingested marijuana edibles (it is no help that many such edibles look exactly like gummy bears). Law enforcement, too, has complained of the difficulty of identifying drugged drivers , whose level of intoxication cannot be easily verified as with alcohol. In addition, research suggests that drivers under the influence of marijuana are 1.65 times more likely to be responsible for fatal accidents."}

Despite there being many children around the world in desperate need of homes, it can take years for a single child to be adopted. Then, adoptive parents must get to know a child who is already born and who biologically belongs to someone else. It may also be challenging to find out a comprehensive health history of the adopted child, which may cause complications later in life for everyone involved. Clearly, adoption is not easy. While the surrogacy process can also be challenging, especially when the surrogate mother is in a different country where war can break out , surrogacy does ensure that intended parents can be involved in their child’s life from the get-go. Intended parents are updated on the surrogate’s pregnancy, and often can attend scans and be present when the baby, often theirs biologically, is born."}

Morocco’s government officially cited security concerns as the reason for its 2017 ban on the sale and manufacture of the burqa (terrorists have used the burqa to hide bombs and other weapons). However, the pretext of deterring the integration of Salafist versions of Islam into Moroccan society is certainly present. In Egypt , where religious scholars and public officials have contested the necessity to cover the face in the name of modesty, universities and hospitals have banned the niqab, and the government has mulled over banning them in public spaces entirely. Controversies surrounding full-face veils in the Muslim world underscore their complex social, religious, and political implications – implications that dictate a need to regulate their use in the public sphere."}

The recent discovery of a super-Earth planet 31 light-years away , and that it could harbor life, suggests that there could be a potentially habitable world outside of our solar system. Even within our own solar system there are several celestial bodies boasting the potential to support life. Jupiter’s icy moon, Europa , for example, contains both a source of radiation strong enough to lead to chemical reactions and evidence of an ocean similar to Earth’s. Similarly, the conditions of Saturn’s moon, Enceladus , could already support an Earth-born microbe (a microscopic organism that is too small to be seen with the naked eye), what with its liquid ocean and hydrothermal reactions. While many speculate that the life we uncover on these moons will likely be microbial , it would be the first step in learning how to search for more complex life forms within our galaxy."}

Take Scottie Pippen , who, despite being a vital asset that lifted both Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls, played most of the 1990s under what is considered one of the worst contracts in NBA history. In fact, some pro athletes in minor league baseball don’t even make minimum wage . This pay gap creates unnecessary tensions within sport teams and is unfair to teammates who sacrifice just as much but for less money."}

By the very act of enlisting in military combat, a soldier has agreed to put his life on the line and die for his people if that’s what’s required of him — and suffering from torture can be a facet of that. Basic military training alone, specifically in elite units, can often involve some form of psychological or physical torture by the hands of a soldier’s own army to help strengthen soldiers’ immunity for worst-case scenarios. Such prisoner-of-war training exercises are par for the course when countries are preparing for war. During actual war, all bets are off, and torture is often an unavoidable consequence."}

In 2020, the Pentagon established a UAP taskforce , which has since been replaced by another government office to continue its research into identifying unidentified objects. Such UFO sightings, which have recently extended over Canada , have ranged from bizarre lights over the New Jersey Turnpike to aircrafts moving faster than sound and hovering around the coast of San Diego.

Unsurprisingly, France and Japan, the world’s biggest nuclear energy consumers, also have the world’s lowest rate of CO2 emissions, demonstrating nuclear energy’s ability to meet their energy demands while helping to make good on its climate commitments . Following the trend, in the spring of 2019, the US signed a deal with India , the world’s third-largest oil buyer, to build six nuclear plants there.

The Montessori method showed that learning could be a comprehensive sensory process, and not one built on passive reading and listening.

The BLM’s huge desire to save their own families from abuse, inequality and murder (especially of unarmed victims, like Trayvon Martin , Breonna Taylor , or Ahmaud Arbery – not to mention George Floyd ) lends power to their cause, which we cannot expect them to feel for any other cause.

With his rugged good looks, charm and charisma , Connery set the sophisticated style of how Bond looked, dressed, wooed women, drank, used a gun and drove a car. He was playful one minute and ruthless the next; a refined tough guy that also infused the role with wry humor and knowing looks. He went on to star in six more James Bond movies, cementing how we think of the on-screen character. He’s come to represent the epitome of 007, and every other Bond since Connery can’t help but be compared to him.

The fact is that people are not born onto even playing fields, and race often widens the divide between competitors.

This was President Johnson’s thinking when he signed the 1965 Voting Rights Act , allowing African Americans to exercise their right to vote. As he stated : “You do not take a person who, for years, has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race, and then say, ‘You are free to compete…’ and still justly believe that you have been completely fair.” This policy helps give minorities the necessary boost to bring them to the starting line where privileged people already stand."}

Poor infrastructure has real consequences – lack of maintenance leads to increased accidents (and deaths, as with the Baltimore bridge collapse ) and inefficiency that cost billions of dollars. Health care is another weak point for America. True, America is not the only country that was caught unprepared for the pandemic.

This is not to say that Ronaldo’s teammates on both teams were bad. They were great, but just not as great as Messi’s during the majority of his career. For example, Messi has played with Neymar Jr . (who is arguably the best player following Messi and Ronaldo) and Luis Suarez , two of the best forwards of the century, and with Xavi Hernandez and Andrés Iniesta, two of the most dominating center-midfielders of our era.

Moses established tithings before any temple ever existed, and today’s Jewish diaspora communities pay dues to their synagogues. Similar to Scientology, the Vatican possesses billions of dollars in assets and derives income from spiritual and secular activities alike. All religions require funding to support their activities, and that funding necessarily comes from the religion’s followers."}

For instance, in the 1930s, when beauty pageants were in full swing, the average Body Mass Index ( BMI ) of a contestant was 20.8, which is mid-range of a healthy BMI. However, in 2010, the average BMI of a contestant dropped to 18.9, which is low and therefore runs the risk of an unhealthy contestant. Coupled with statistics that 26% of surveyed contestants have reported being perceived to have an eating disorder, 48.5% have reported wanting to be thinner and 6% of contestants have reported having depression, beauty pageants can be viewed as feeding insecurities and real health risks for contestants. The pressure to attain and maintain such unrealistic body standards is also dangerous for non-contestants, as there is a clear disconnect between the BMI of the average viewer and that of contestants, whom they try but fail to emulate."}

The chances of dying at the hands of another human is generally higher in non-state societies, and one widely quoted estimate by psychologist Steven Pinker places the death rate resulting from lethal violence in ancient non-state societies, based on archaeological evidence, at a shocking 15% of the population.

(Take former NYC mayor Michael Bloomberg , who has been a Republican, Independent and a Democrat, including even a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate or Robert Kennedy Jr , who was a lifelong Democrat from a legendary family of Democrats and is now running for US President as an Independent).

Coupled with the scholarships awarded by various pageants themselves, which began at $5,000 in 1921 and more recently soared to a $50,000 scholarship , the pageant industry has opened doors for women across America and the world. Some past Miss Universe winners have gone on to successful modeling, acting, entrepreneurial careers as well as non-profit work. Past Miss USA winner Gretchen Carlson used her crowned victory to launch an esteemed broadcast journalism career before being named chairwoman of the Miss America Organization’s board in January 2018.

Today’s high school students mostly attend co-ed schools, and therefore have no need of such introductions. Not to mention that some teens are opting out of using gender identities altogether. Moreover, the dances tend to be haunted by a bevy of traditional ideals that do not reflect modern youth or social standards. For example, dress codes mostly target female students, equating female dress with sexuality and ultimately discouraging young ladies’ right to choose their attire. LGBT students have reportedly fallen victim to dress codes and worse, date codes, which tend to strictly enforce heterosexuality. What’s more, there are many cases where transgender students – even ones accepted by their peers – have been rebuffed by their schools’ administration when wanting to run for prom court . Come on, prom. Setting strictures on how to dress and who to date is so 19th century."}

It’s likely that many members of the populations being attended to have never been able to leave their country – in some cases, even their villages – and volunteering abroad can help bridge the gap between people who otherwise may never have met. Because of these interactions, volunteers bring home a greater worldview that can help them raise awareness of global societal issues, to hopefully motivate others to volunteer as well. Studies show that communities with high levels of voluntary activity are associated with better health, lower crime rates, and greater life satisfaction, so these volunteer-community interactions can be helpful to both parties."}

In fact, while it has damaged the American economy, its impact has arguably been worse south of the border. Mexican farmers have been particularly hard hit , struggling to compete with highly subsidized American produce, including corn. Wages have dropped dramatically, as 1.1 million small farmers lost work in the first 12 years of NAFTA. Today, the average Mexican earns less money than before NAFTA—one of the reasons illegal immigration to the United States nearly tripled in the pact’s first 20 years. The new NAFTA deal promises to boost wages in Mexico and improve that country’s outdated labor laws and questionable labor union practices."}

Cruelly, society blames women for the violence committed against them, often postulating how she might have brought the trouble on herself . The only way to oppose such attitudes (and realities) is to increase legal measures against those who perpetuate the prostitution industry."}

More than this, Scientology shares characteristics with other religions . Like Buddhism, Hinduism, the Abrahamic religions and countless others, Scientology attempts to help man reconcile his lesser demons and cultivate positive behavior. It provides an origin story for the ills of man, and it is arguably no more (or less) far-fetched than those espoused by other religions. (Who’s to say that an intergalactic explosion of alien spirits is a less plausible beginning of human evil than a snake talking a woman into eating a piece of fruit?) In form and function, Scientology is a religion like any other."}

One Afghani journalist decried the unilateral nature of drone attacks in Afghanistan, saying they undermined and destabilized the unity government, which the US itself had fought hard to help the Afghanis create. Similarly, in 2013, Pakistan’s prime minister repeatedly called upon Barak Obama to cease drone strikes there, citing the need for collaboration on security matters. Just as the United States would not tolerate any country operating on its soil without permission, the US should not expect such actions will be tolerated by other nations. Plus, the 2018 assassination attempt of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro involving drones carrying explosives goes to show how drones, in unrestrained hands, can increase instead of decrease geopolitical instability. While some say that drones are aiding the Ukrainians against the Russians, others argue that they are actually enabling the war to carry on."}

Over the course of 11 seasons, winning over viewers across the country, the show demonstrated the universal appeal of country values . (That being said, it is believed that the show ended due to controversial comments made by some of its stars). Similarly, reality television encourages society to include marginalized groups by presenting them with relatable casts. In its first iteration back in 2003, gay men rescued clueless heteros in Queer Eye for the Straight Guy ; the format was so popular that it spurred a reboot on Netflix in 2018. And Lifetime’s Little Women respectfully approached the lives of women with dwarfism. By allowing diverse stories to emerge from all corners of society, reality TV broadens our horizons and humanizes the unknown."}

The latest version of this manual has a significantly expanded list of diagnostic criteria, which includes behaviors most of us engage in on a daily basis (i.e., losing your keys – come on!). Unsurprisingly, a study that compared ADHD diagnoses between doctors who used an older DSM version and those who used the new edition (with broader criteria) showed that doctors using the new criteria diagnosed ADHD more frequently . A comparison of the DSM to the World Health Organization’s IDC, a manual whose criteria for ADHD is narrower, showed that the IDC manual led to fewer ADHD diagnoses."}

However, it simultaneously prevents new, younger players from developing their MLB careers. As the batting spots are taken by overpaid older players, who only bat and never take the field, talented young hitters yearning for an opportunity to display their batting abilities don’t get the chance to do so. Over the decades, the American League has most likely missed out on some talented players because of DH. The National League will now likely experience the same."}

Simply being famous provides a wider platform for celebrities to get a message across. When Michelle Obama took to social media in 2016 to raise awareness for kidnapped Nigerian girls, the world paid attention. In 2018, after Taylor Swift broke her long-held silence on politics, voter registration spiked by 65,000 new registered voters in the first 24 hours.

The social connection and acceptance everyone feels is no small thing for people whose comic book hobby may have previously isolated them. This was especially true in 2020, when the pandemic forced people to stay home and remain socially distanced from one another; superhero fandom has adapted itself to the pandemic , and connections between fans as well as new ideas actually grew (including how to incorporate Covid masks into cosplay). Not to mention that over the years, modern fandom has taken on a new meaning of cool, so much so that a few years ago, MTV created Fandom Awards , a sign of embracing and celebrating fans’ enthusiasm instead of raising eyebrows to it."}

The woman’s unique childbearing capabilities are recognized and used to bring money in. The issue of consent is at times unclear. Countries like India offer surrogacy services to Western countries at a fraction of the cost, which can be seen as exploiting women as baby-making machines for a pittance. The low price tag can be tempting to couples and individuals of higher economic means who are desperate to expand their families, driving them to enter into surrogacy agreements with third-world women, despite the way these contracts may affect these surrogates. In Ukraine, for example, couples may pay anywhere between $30K-$50K for the process while the surrogate mothers reportedly receive only a small fraction of this sum."}

They also created an impersonator account from which they spewed vitriol of all manner. Celebrities are certainly not the only people to suffer abuse from internet trolls.

In 2015, that year’s top tax rate was less than half the 91 percent it was under President Eisenhower , a Republican. The top rate was consistently 70 percent or higher until the Reagan tax cuts of the 1980s, and those cuts resulted in the national debt tripling in eight years."}

It’s a contemporary soundtrack that became the best-selling cast album in Nielsen history.

Not only can dogs be easily trained to play and do tricks, but they can also be trained to do actual jobs that make a real difference in society. It helps that dogs are scientifically proven to be as smart as 2-year-old kids.

No materials are needed to build walls or separate areas into cubicles. No individual desks need to be purchased, and the space can easily be reconfigured as required. Again, before the current health pandemic changed how we think about working alongside others , an open floor plan often enabled more employees to work in a single space, enabling a better value for the cost of the company’s office rental. This way, companies could invest more money into business operations and rewarding employee achievements instead of into office construction and maintenance. Who knows, maybe the money saved on office planning could have been used to fund company fun days or other morale-boosting events."}

At first, it was difficult for companies to sell it to consumers without helping them experience; in 2016, thousands of headsets were launched and sold with VR games for the first time, bringing the experience to millions of new users, helping to spread the word. Since then, the VR Awards have kept consumers abreast of the latest and the greatest innovations in VR, and not just for gamers. Not to mention, as the pandemic has increased the number of remote workers , the sales of VR headsets have also increased.

According to the World Economic Forum, it usually takes around 10 years for a vaccine to be researched, developed, tested, approved and manufactured. Of that, the first 2-5 years are for discovery research alone. Today, scientific researchers and pharmaceutical companies have worked at unprecedented speed to create a vaccine . Some companies, like Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca have already introduced their vaccinations into the world, while other companies are not far behind – less than 1 year into the pandemic.

Citizens and visitors are allowed to pray and practice their religion freely. Another key argument against labeling Israel as an apartheid state is its democratic structure and commitment to democratic principles. Arab Israeli citizens , who compose 21% of the Israeli population, can and have served in Israel’s parliament and other positions in government, including diplomatic roles and as judges in the country’s courts, including on the Supreme Court . They are entitled to the same municipal and educational services and have the same municipal voting rights as Jewish Israelis.

With a price tag in the hundreds of thousands to train one US Navy Seal, the US armed forces have a clear economic incentive (in addition to the moral one) to risk as few soldiers – not to mention civilians – as possible to accomplish the nation’s security goals. Remotely operated drone strikes preserve soldiers’ lives by removing them from the site of conflict, full stop. The Pentagon’s 2024 fiscal-year budget of $842 billion, the largest, nominal-dollar peacetime budget ever, includes spending requests for the procurement of 1000 drone wingmen to accompany combat aircraft. That’s already thousands of lives saved. Moreover, depending upon the type of drone, they can cost more than $18.5K per flight per hour, drones are still cheaper to build than bombers and far easier to maintain (and protect) than a standing army. Their lower costs and higher efficiency make them one of the most valuable tools in the military’s arsenal, and their use should be encouraged."}

The EC mechanism , which, in essence, represents an indirect election of the president and vice president, was founded on the belief that the common people couldn’t be trusted to elect a president for themselves – i.e., a distrust of democracy . Yet, putting the fate of a country’s presidency in the hands of a few – the small body of pre-appointed electors – is risky and unfair, especially if they turn out to be faithless electors . In 16 states , electors are not bound to act in accordance with the voters’ wishes, though many of the remaining states do have laws or severe fines for’ electors if they go against their pledges. As previously mentioned, the Supreme Court decided in July 2020 that it was legal to require electors to support the candidate they pledged to support or face penalties. This case is a consequence of 10 electors in Washington and Colorado who refused to cast their votes for Hillary Clinton in 2016 regardless of whether she won the popular vote. But it is not an isolated case. In 2004, a Democratic Minnesota elector voted for John Edwards instead of John Kerry.

To regain its market share, Coca-Cola tried to literally sweeten the competition, transforming its product into New Coke . While this sweeter version failed , it made the company return to its roots, rebranding itself as Coca-Cola Classic and pushing its popular Diet Coke, to great success. In 2020, Forbes’ list of the world’s most popular brands ranked Coca-Cola as the world’s sixth most popular brand whereas Pepsi is ranked #36 on the same list.

This shows how if honesty weren’t a basic tenet of society, whole chunks of our social fabric would crumble. Look no further than the Flint water crisis in Michigan in 2014 as an example of dishonesty posing health risks to society; thousands of people were lied to about the unhealthy, lead-ridden state of their water, and many got sick as a result.

This charged atmosphere often leads to violence that proves counterproductive to protest goals . Look no further than Antifa protestors and their embrace of violence, which tends to undermine their aims of fighting against fascism. Does the current wave of pro-Palestinian protests that have erupted in civil disobedience, violence and cancelled university graduations really help the Palestinians achieve statehood?

However, unlike Jordan, James led an arguably average Cleveland Cavaliers to win the NBA championship in 2016. In each subsequent season with them until he left to join the LA Lakers in 2018, James’ leadership in getting the Cavs to the finals was also a truly special achievement . While the Cavs ended up losing those subsequent finals, it was only because James faced a stacked Golden State Warriors team with far more individual quality than the Cavs. In both Cleveland and LA, James has proven that he can be a true leader , making everyone else around him bring their A-game."}

While open adoption does answer important questions of origin for adoptees, it does not necessarily abate a person’s grief about having been placed. It also does not make one immune to emotional complications that can arise from the adoptees’ relationship with his or her birth family. One adoptee recalls the anger and confusion she felt when her birth mother informed her that she would raise her biological sister. Another expressed fears of alienation and abandonment despite her positive views of being raised in an open adoption. In addition, power struggles could arise, where the adoptee could try to play one family against another. When it comes to mitigating the emotional consequences of adoption, there simply is no silver bullet."}

Communications scholar Eric Jenkins contends that Disney has engineered this and “not only promotes consumerist behavior but trains us in the habits of consumerism.” Disney animation encourages viewers to project emotions onto objects; buying Disney products offers further interaction with these emotions. Disney has endless avenues for communication, and this communication ensures the company such ubiquity that it consistently ranks among the world’s most powerful brands ."}

It is therefore questionable why America did not require by law face masks to be worn in public nationwide, as was mandated in numerous other countries . Instead, the federal government left it up to state governors to decide. Of those who did require face masks in 37 states (as of January 2021), most have not legally enforced compliance statewide. Only now, one year after the pandemic began, President Biden has signed an executive order to mandate mask-wearing for federal employees as well as visitors while on federal lands or when traveling. Time will tell if and how it will be enforced."}

According to Cameron, the thought process of Jack’s character was such that he wouldn’t have attempted to do anything to put Rose’s life in jeopardy, including getting on that raft."}

The placebo effect – which is when a person positively or negatively responds to fake treatment when they believe that the treatment is real – is a good demonstrator of this. In fact, a study of the placebo effect demonstrated that people with depression who show improvement while taking fake drugs get the most benefit when taking antidepressants. Just knowing that the pills are there provide comfort can be an encouragement to your brain to fight depression along with the medicine."}

Businesses may not like to admit it, but they would be less likely to hire women of child-bearing age just to avoid facing the extra cost of paying their maternity leave. People argue that discrimination laws would prevent this from happening, but it’s often almost impossible to prove why a company hired one person rather than another. Alternatively, all women would end up being paid a lower wage to balance out the expected cost of maternity leave. Paid maternity leave would be especially unfair on women who don’t have children, who would be paid a lower wage without even getting the benefit of taking leave."}

Whereas fossil fuel companies are required by law to clean and restore any damage they cause at their own cost, as of 2011, nuclear companies were exempt from responsibility if the damage is too extensive – a strange exception given the fact that nuclear accidents are inevitably more expensive, more dangerous, and farther-reaching than oil spills."}

Take the Great Recession as an example, where unemployment rose by record levels, yet the poverty rate only increased by 0.5% . These social benefits also contribute to a more economically efficient society; for example, research found that increasing food stamps programs and public insurance in several states led to more entrepreneurship , because they made it less risky for would-be business owners to venture out on their own . Unemployment benefits also provide people leeway to find jobs that match their skill sets, rather than snapping up the first available position. In other words, overall economic productivity increases as a result of government assistance."}

Given athletes’ large salaries, more youngsters want to become professional athletes – but for the big money, not for the love of the game. This change in purpose has a negative impact on athletes’ ambition to play. Take Albert Haynesworth of the Washington Redskins. Once he signed a $100 million contract with a $44 million guarantee, he had what some consider to be his worst season ever; it seemed like he simply lost interest in the game. Professional athletes competing for money rather than for excellence will take the soul and magic out of sports, ruining it in the long run – for athletes and for fans."}

Downloading illegally from the internet is a violation of copyright , and at its core – stealing. Currently, Unites States had the highest number of media piracy site visits, with about 12.5 billion visits to piracy sites in 2020 .

Refraining from using the word “retarded” to mean “stupid” is a basic show of respect for anybody who is cognitively impaired. While PC culture may sometimes feel a bit forced or insincere, its intention is to be respectful and not to insult anyone. Even if we overdo it, it is a work in progress, which may take time to find a healthy balance that is easier to live up to.

Queen Elizabeth II’s 1952 coronation provides an excellent example. While Great Britain was recovering from the ravages of WWII, a country whose citizens were living on rations held an outsized ceremony to commemorate their new queen. In the former Queen’s prosperity, the people of England saw their own prosperity, and the coronation a shining symbol of English perseverance. Moreover, there is something profoundly comforting in knowing that if the state’s political institutions go berserk – or get sidelined by the coronavirus – there is a statesperson prepared to take the reins."}

Recent record-breaking heat waves and forest fires, as well as lack of rain in various countries around the world are likely products of human carelessness. Humanity’s oldest texts have stressed man’s responsibility to safeguard the world in which he lives. Genesis 1:26-27 tells us: “Let [man] rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth.” Here, man is assigned custodianship of the Earth and its creatures. If God’s great variety of species and ecosystems are to be preserved, it must be up to man to preserve them."}

Many people enjoy listening to the music of Kanye West even though they find his opinions distasteful. The same can be said for the music of Chris Brown , even after he beat up Rihanna. People also appreciate movies starring or directed by Mel Gibson despite their disgust for his apparent anti-Semitism. Music and movies are not affected by the personal opinions or even the actions of their creators. If you go to a museum and you are moved by a painting by Picasso , does it become less moving if you know it was painted by a man who was abusive to his wives ? Even Martin Luther King’s known adultery didn’t undermine the power and pathos of his oratory. Perhaps we need artists to live the tortured lives of self-destruction which produce great art — but in that case, we have no right to disown them when they manifest the darkness that so fascinates us."}

(In fact, the country was the world’s third largest exporter in 2019.) On the other end of the spectrum, Greece adopted a stronger currency, which made their products more expensive on the international market; the country was later held back during its 2015 debt crisis by being unable to devalue said currency, which would have raised much-needed money by increasing exports. Spain faced the same issues when it went through a depression in 2012."}

When Reagan took office, he brought a new economic approach, lowering taxes and lifting burdensome regulations. While it took a couple years to get going, Reagan’s economy was a model of strength. From 1983 to 1988, annual GDP growth never dipped below 3.5 percent (for context, the last time the US hit that mark was 2005 – before surging to 5.9 percent in 2021). In 1984, growth reached a whopping 7.3 percent, the highest mark since 1951. Unemployment fell from over 10 percent in 1983 to just above 5 percent when Reagan’s term ended. While Reagan did run a deficit, the severity is often exaggerated. Barack Obama and George W. Bush added more to the debt in 2009 alone than Reagan did in eight years in office."}

With an estimated budget of $6 million that Wiseau funded himself, he essentially bought the rights to enable his mistreatment of cast and crew, subjecting them to unfair conditions as well as emotional trauma. A film that is not based on skill or talent is doomed to reflect the darker side of fame-seeking and power. Supporting this is, at the core, hypocritical of an empathetic audience . In an industry where the producer calls the shots, Tommy Wiseau was judge, jury and executioner, the exact culture we are supposedly trying to bury."}

In recent years, pre-pandemic, large retailers like Macy’s and JCPenney’s laid off nearly 100,000 workers . In 2018, Toys ‘R’ Us was forced to close its doors due to many reasons, including e-commerce (though, after a painful bankruptcy, it has reopened two stores in the US). Experts have been wary that the internet and e-commerce sectors are not generating new retail jobs at the pace that they’re eliminating old ones. Many of those laid-off workers don’t have the technical skills required to pursue the kind of jobs the internet is creating a demand for, like blockchain, AI, data science, and UX design. As such, these workers are effectively locked into underemployment or unemployment."}

This is, in part, what contributed to the rise of WeWork , the global chain of shared office spaces that transformed the way startups interacted with one another before its sudden decline in 2019. In spaces like WeWork offices , the improved communication that resulted from a lack of physical barriers enabled employees to collaborate freely – bounce ideas off of each other and ask for assistance, as needs arose. Such fluid communication enabled workers to establish relationships with their colleagues and create an atmosphere of greater teamwork and fulfillment. Ditching the concept of corner offices can also help those in management positions stay more connected to company culture and employees’ mindset."}

In fact, some critics even go so far as saying that during the height of the global pandemic, he played with his employees’ lives by re-opening his Tesla plant even after two Tesla workers tested positive for COVID-19 and before California authorities recommended re-opening for business. Health risks aside, SpaceX staff have often been presented with impossible tasks , like pulling all-nighters after working 12-hour days, in order to meet the deadlines Musk expects from them. His Tesla workers filed charges in 2017 with the National Labor Board against him, citing coercion, hazardous working conditions, intimidation, illegal surveillance and prevention of worker communications as their main reasons for doing so. Most recently, his attitude toward Twitter is seen by some as nothing short of bullying : He has reportedly disparaged Twitter execs, ridiculed the site’s content policies and complained about a lack of professionalism, all resulting in plummeting the company’s stock prices and morale. After declaring he could run it better, he then walked away from the deal, with no regard for its employees."}

Yet, studies have shown that students are more successful when focused on learning rather than on exam performance. According to the National Council of Teachers of English , subjects such as art, social studies, foreign languages and music have been sidelined, as they are generally not tested on. In this vein, tests like the SATs – which only test for math and reading – don’t account for students’ strengths in other areas of learning, and only encourage a narrowing of the high school curriculum. These tests should be an evaluation tool for students’ overall intellect instead of only evaluating their test-taking abilities."}

In fact, a study suggests that in recent years, on campuses of top colleges, over the years, Democratic professors have increasingly outnumbered Republicans; and the trend shows no signs of slowing down. Add to this the regular exclusion of Conservative speakers on college campuses in the recent past, and the current rise of cancel culture in academia, university campuses are little more than a canvas for progressive hegemony, one with little hope of genuinely liberalizing its student body."}

Over the decades, despite ongoing violence, Israel has participated in peace talks with the Palestinian Authority (PA) and has made concessions in pursuit of a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The IDF pulled out of Gaza unilaterally in 2005, giving the Palestinians an opportunity to build their own country. It wasn’t a perfect situation, but thriving and nation-building were viable options. One of the first acts on behalf of the Palestinians in Gaza following Israeli withdrawal was to loot and destroy the greenhouses that were positioned there by donors for their welfare. Israelis kept on watching as Hamas was elected and made a clear choice to divert all resources to war infrastructure instead of the welfare of its citizens – with billions of dollars used to create tunnel networks of terror, which still house Israeli civilian hostages – instead of building a self-sustaining society and tourist-friendly destination."}

This population distribution means that Middle America would have much less of an influence on the election outcome than those residing in densely populated coastal cities if the outcome were left only to the popular vote.

{"id": 497, "content": "Freud’s groundbreaking work in developing psychoanalysis laid the foundation for modern psychology. Throughout the early 19th century, pre-Freud, psychological treatment for people who suffered from mental illness didn’t really exist . Back then, those who suffered from mental illness were typically sent to prisons or asylums. Experts at that time resorted to hypnosis or dubious treatments that included static electricity or bloodletting, among others. Drugs were also used, but more to subdue patients rather than treat them. The overriding conclusion pre-Freud was that mental illness was a result of physical impairment to the brain. His pioneering ideas sought to look deep into the human psyche and seek insights into the sources of people’s emotional conflicts. In so doing, he transformed people’s understanding of human behavior, especially with regard to treating mental disorders instead of just (mis)classifying them. Worth nothing is that nearly 20% of Americans experience mental illness. How different would their lives – and the lives of their families – look today without Freud’s impact?"}

Parents have a number of valid reasons to dread homework as much as their kids do – it forces their children to keep sitting after a long, mostly sedentary school-day; it cuts into family bonding time and diminishes opportunities for kids to take on other household duties. This is to say nothing of the pressure of guiding a child on homework that a parent may or may not understand. If homework is not welcome by parents or students, it can potentially damage the overall academic experience as well as a student’s home life as well."}

This stands in stark contrast to other sports that celebrate and strongly encourage participants to push through injuries . Meanwhile, in MMA, fighters go through a thorough examination before every fight that ensures they are physically ready. This procedure and commitment to safety has led to last-minute match cancellations throughout the years. Most recently, MMA legend Connor McGregor was forced at the last minute to pull out of the UFC 303 due to injury. Such cancellations have surely cost organizers quite a bit of money but demonstrate how important safety is in MMA."}

But, there is a downside to it; in their fervor to play their best, many college athletes suffer serious injuries that sometimes prematurely end their career.

Once a public apology addresses the elephant in the room, action must be taken. When a public figure is in the spotlight of a scandal, everyone around them becomes involved in the conversation . For example, when allegations of sexual assault came out against Louis C.K., his close friend, Sarah Silverman , was among the first to comment. As the allegations were confirmed, more comics made statements fueling the conversation. Marc Maron, Jon Stewart and Bill Burr, were among friends and co-workers weighing in on the ugliness. A public apology fans the flame of interest and has the potential to spark further debate, which, ultimately, may bring awareness to sensitive issues like holding people accountable for their actions, which may further legitimize the victims’ feelings."}

Greenspan followed conventional wisdom in keeping interest rates low after the dot-com bust and the September 11 attacks, a defensible decision. But he kept cutting rates for the next two years, even as the economy was out of the woods. The Federal Funds Rate dropped to a low of 1% in 2003 and did not begin the slow crawl back up until 2004. The low rates were a major contributor to the housing bubble. They helped heat up the economy, providing an initial boom but paving the way for eventual crisis."}

Shouting “Black Lives Matter” could move the focus away from dealing with white privilege as a source of social inequality. Because the hashtag seems to reiterate that what matters are Black lives, it risks shining the spotlight on only one small aspect of a much bigger and more problematic issue. The “All Lives Matter” motto can serve as an umbrella slogan that opposes restricting privilege to just one group, instead of potentially implying that the problem could be solved if only Black Americans were included in the said privilege."}

As research continues and technologies improve, there will be even more advances in renewable energy – and at lower costs. And with technological growth comes job creation , not only in the US but also worldwide. While fossil fuel technologies are mostly mechanized, the renewable energy industry is more about labor. According to the Environmental Defense Fund , jobs in the solar and wind power sectors have grown at about 20% annually in recent years. And this is just the beginning."}

Unlike Jordan, James has no problem letting go of the ball and passing it to a teammate. His ability to read the game and other players and involve his team when needed makes him that much harder to play against (maybe even “unguardable”), rather than an individual who keeps the ball all the time. Providing teammates with key assists are a big part of James’s game, whereas Jordan was always seen as more of a selfish player."}

While Antifa and white nationalist movements both express distaste for the government (and even a will to overthrow it), their reasons for these sentiments are rather opposite. Antifa, whose members also frequently identify as anarchists, view government as an instrument of inequality, while white nationalists express hostility toward government because they believe it facilitates equality – a notion that offends those whose identity is built upon a defined racial hierarchy."}

We need only to look back at the last time another superpower – the Soviet Union – challenged the US for global supremacy; only because of US protection was Western Europe able to thrive without falling to the grasp of Soviet tentacles. Meanwhile, regional hegemons like Iran would be free to impose their will on smaller nations without the credible threat of sanctions and force from the US."}

This makes Amazon’s comparison-shopping of brand vs. brand or product vs. related product fast and effortless. Another benefit of shopping on Amazon is the immediacy in which purchases are received. With services like Amazon Prime, the customer journey of “search – select – pay – possess” is near-instantaneous. Since Amazon delivers nearly two-thirds of its own orders directly to consumers, it’s no wonder that the company is giving UPS and FedEx a run for their money, competition that will only benefit consumers. It’s much faster than most other e-commerce stores. This benefit was appreciated during the pandemic lockdowns, as with efforts to combat price gouging. Being the market leader means that the standard Amazon adopts becomes the market standard, which, in turn, benefits all consumers. This can also be seen with Amazon’s PillPack acquisition , which highlights how its embrace of disruptive competition is a good thing for consumers."}

The BLM’s huge desire to save their own families from abuse, inequality and murder (especially of unarmed victims, like Trayvon Martin , Breonna Taylor , or Ahmaud Arbery – not to mention George Floyd ) lends power to their cause, which we cannot expect them to feel for any other cause. The BLM’s focus on Black Lives does not undermine the worthiness of any other minority’s fight against racism or of any other social justice issue; it merely indicates that this is the issue that they are standing up for right now."}

This was the reality for many in the US before the National Labor Union was introduced in 1886. There was no minimum wage or standard of safety regulations until unions established a precedent with the Fair Labor Standards Act , which put limits on child labor and demanded fair pay for overtime work. The benefits many in the workforce have come to rely on are also a result of past unions’ work; dramatic improvements that we now take for granted, such as sick leave, paid vacation, including for Labor Day , which celebrates workers, and pension, were only introduced into the workforce after unions fought against the terrible conditions that plagued the working class. Still today, unionization is way for employees to fight for better working conditions, though attempts to unionize may be challenging (just ask some Starbucks workers) or may not always be successful (just as some Amazon workers)."}

For people unable to conceive due to infertility or medical conditions, surrogacy can be one of the only ways in which they finally create a family .

Plus, having kids and forming a family has been positively linked with increased parental happiness, productivity and longevity , for all family members. Some research even suggests that parents are happier than non-parents later in life , once their children move out.

Back in those days, the dichotomy was clear: If you`re a tall player, you`re a forward and play like a forward, meaning that you play closer to the rim, concentrate on rebounding, and rarely dribble. Magic changed that: He was a tall all-around point guard who handled the ball with great talent, passed it perfectly, took it to the rim, and rebounded. He paved the way for today’s all-around players, like Kevin Durant and LeBron James . Moreover, Magic marked the transformation of the game from a solid half-court game to one played on a full court, on the run, and above the rim."}

(This is despite Pepsi’s 2017 advertisement fiasco with Kendall Jenner attempting but failing to engage Millennials by promoting social responsibility.) Pepsi introduced “ the Pepsi Generation ” in the 1960s, marketing itself to the younger, hipper, more daring teen and pre-teen segment, relying on celebrities to show how youthful and energizing the beverage is. (It also appealed to younger consumers by being cheaper than its rival.) In contrast, Coca-Cola has always represented itself as classic Americana , endearing itself to older, more traditional consumers, playing to their emotions , and promoting a reliable drink that goes well with any kind of food or company. Its most memorable embodiment of comradery, unity and diversity was Coca-Cola’s iconic 1970s advertisement that showed people singing about harmony on a hilltop .

In the moment it may seem like a good idea but binge-watching before bed can make the next day a difficult one to get through. A recent survey shows that 88% of US adults and 95% of 14 to 44-year-olds have lost sleep because of staying up late to binge-watch multiple episodes of a TV show or streaming series. Binge-watching doesn’t only impact your sleep. A Scottish study from the University of Glasgow asserts that watching more than 2 hours and 12 minutes of television a day is not only bad for your mental and physical health but can actually lead to an early death. Spending long periods sitting in one place can slow your metabolism and contribute to developing potentially fatal blood clots. Not to mention that binge-watching may lead to binge-eating.

More recently, more recently, 65% of parents said that homework-related stress negatively impacted their families. Homework stress may affect students’ health by causing headaches and stomach problems. Some children experience sleep deprivation by staying up too late to finish their homework. This is harmful to both kids’ health and their learning abilities, as sleep has been shown to help with memory consolidation .

Let’s say for the sake of argument that, for example, an impressive $100,000-a-year salary for a college athlete would grant him only a few hundred dollars more per year than a scholarship. Let’s just estimate that a full athletic scholarship at an NCAA Division I university is about $65,000 a year. This includes tuition, room, board, and books (if you enroll at a college with high tuition). In contrast, a salary will be subjected to federal and state income taxes. Therefore, out of the $100,000, a net of $65,100 would remain for the student. The difference is marginal."}

During the Vietnam war, the North Vietnamese government re-purposed the Hoa Lo Prison in order to torture American POWs for information. If suspects (terrorists or otherwise) pose a threat to a nation and play by a different set of rules – rules that include the use of torture – the opposing government may have no choice but to do so as well.

This has long been recognized as discrimination that favors other minority groups over Asian-Americans, which goes against the logic of what affirmative action is trying to do.

Also, nobody who has ever watched Serena Williams play tennis can deny that sheer skill is what has won her 23 Grand Slam titles (although her muscles definitely help). While men and women may differ in physicality, they do not differ in their skills capacity. This is why former tennis star John McEnroe faced backlash in 2017 when he dismissed Williams as the sport’s greatest tennis player and, instead, clarified that she may be the sport’s best female player.

In fact, the blood often seen in MMA is caused by blows to the nose or facial cuts, which tend to look much worse than they are. Unlike other athletes that compete very regularly, MMA fighters only get into the ring between one and five times year . Training happens in very safe conditions, making serious injury very unlikely.

Moana’s depiction of the demigod Maui as gigantic is considered among Polynesians as insensitive , considering that the obesity rate in the South Pacific is the highest in the world. And while many Disney movies are peppered with insensitive depictions of cultures, Arabs receive some of the worst treatment. The Phrygian opening song of Aladdin relates the “facts” of the Arab world that the audience is expected to accept: “ It’s barbaric, but hey, it’s home .” Aladdin’s hero is a thief, its law enforcement filled with easily duped zealots, their Sultan imbecilic, and its villain an evil sorcerer.

Also, in addition to getting paid less ( 82 cents for every dollar a man earns), women are still often given – and expected to do – menial tasks in the workplace. In office meetings as well as in online meetings , women are discouraged from voicing their opinions and are listened to less than men are. In fact, women employees were experiencing condescension from their male coworkers so much that a new term was coined for it: mansplaining . Apparently, women get mansplained to six times a week . With such a negative, sexist office culture, we can’t claim to have a society that treats women equally."}

Because the prejudice and racism suffered by each minority takes a different form, it is unrealistic and unfair to both Black Americans and other American minorities to request that the BLM movement speaks for everyone. BLM activists only know what it is like to live as Black people in America, especially regarding issues of police brutality ; therefore, they should not take it upon themselves to speak for Latin-Americans, Asian-Americans or Hispanic Americans. Moreover, saying that all lives matter can be seen as downplaying the racism specifically targeted at Black Americans or shifting attention away from them to other groups. Why take the microphone away from BLM activists when doing so can be interpreted as a form of silencing them ?"}

Snowden may have argued that he was acting nobly, but it was actually careless, as journalists and their editors aren’t qualified to decide such legal matters, especially when their interests are about selling newspapers, not protecting U.S. national security."}

Even for those workers who did not lose their jobs, the threat of competition from Mexico lowered wages for Americans in industries such as textile, apparel, and automotive manufacturing. Some business owners and managers do not have to move to Mexico to save on labor costs – they simply must threaten to do so . During collective bargaining, managers can say that they will move their plants south if workers do not meet their terms, and employees can hardly afford to call their bluff. Similarly, this discouraged unionization, a boon for corporations but not for their employees. However, the new NAFTA deal is likely to be beneficial for trade unions . NAFTA is not the only reason wages have been stagnant ever since its signing, but it certainly has not helped. The election of President Trump following his rejection of the trade deal was a clear referendum on how American workers feel NAFTA has worked out for them. And the president’s new agreement promises to reward them."}
{"id": 558, "content": "America was founded on a set of principles laid out by the Founding Fathers, one of which being that any president who wins an election through the majority of electoral votes has earned the legitimacy to preside over America. The Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution provides that legitimacy, by ensuring that the president is elected by a majority vote – which doesn’t necessarily happen with the popular vote. For example, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote in the 2016 election, accruing 48.2% of the vote in comparison to Trump’s 46.1%; the rest of the votes were split across candidates from independent parties. In other words, neither Trump nor Clinton got the majority of the popular vote. The EC serves to ensure that one candidate has a majority win and is therefore deserving of the presidency. Changing the entire political system that has always defined America could have drastic, unintended consequences."}

Some consider Fox as less committed to accuracy and journalistic standards than its competitors. The news channel has been criticized for making light of the January 6 capitol riots . This starts at the top: The Chief Executive of Fox Corporation Lachlan Murdoch was reportedly unaware of the decision by Fox News hosts to play down the threat of the coronavirus on air, giving precedence, instead, to a potential business deal. In the past, Politifact , a non-partisan fact-checking website, rated more than 150 statements made on Fox News by pundits or their guests. Sixty percent were rated Mostly False, False, or Pants on Fire. This compares to just 27 percent for CNN, and 41 percent for MSNBC, the network’s liberal competitor. Fox News has also never won a Peabody Award (though other Fox affiliates, including FX, have). There’s a place for punditry, but at other networks, it takes a backseat to journalism.

However, even with tighter security, conversations on misogyny, racism and general rage, which tend to run rampant in online forums, may leak over into the events themselves. At the 2017 Comic-Con, actor Jason Momoa came under fire after joking about rape on a panel. Anti-gay controversy has also arisen in past panels, and it doesn’t help that conventions have also become increasingly political and therefore somewhat divisive with time.

To determine the level of athleticism needed, each sport was broken down into 10 categories: endurance, strength, power, speed, agility, flexibility, nerve, durability, hand-eye coordination and analytic aptitude. Then, the experts ranked each category for each sport. The average represents the difficulty level of each sport.

Plus, symbols, which many people choose as a tattoo, change over time, or are appropriated for different agendas of various ideologies. For example, the swastika, which was once a positive symbol in almost every culture, became the threatening insignia of the Nazi party. Even the “OK” hand sign, intended to convey that everything is going well, was adopted by the alt-right as a divisive political statement.

Prom is widely regarded as an appropriate moment for parents to finally loosen the reins on their teens and allow them to socialize freely as young adults.

How would these countries be able to accommodate an influx of refugees during times of poor economic conditions? The newcomers require jobs to complete their integration, and it would be paradoxical for countries to commit to finding occupations for foreigners while their own citizens go jobless.

Not to mention reports that assert that Google tends to push news stories for left-leaning readers. Journalists, whether at Fox News or elsewhere, are professionals, and part of that professionalism is putting their own views aside to report a story accurately, as Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson did when warning about the dangers of coronavirus earlier than most, if not all, of his colleagues. However, it is unrealistic to think ideology plays no part. Just look at the effect of the media bubble after the 2016 US presidential elections.

Similarly, with Great Literature, people create the meaning they need and extract their experience from the rich layers of a truly great text. Readers who come back to the same text in different points in their lives will read it differently because they are different.

Also, the world’s most recent outbreak of cholera in 2010, after an earthquake rocked Haiti, points to the UN. Genome testing demonstrated that the source of the plague, which infected over one million people and killed 10,000, was most likely a Nepali UN peacekeeping force. A UN- appointed panel of experts found that the cholera strain diagnosed in Haiti was “a perfect match” for a strain found in Nepal. Nepalese peacekeepers were staying at the UN camp in Haiti during the earthquake, and poor sanitation flooded local waterways with sewage from the camp. Such unintended consequences show that the UN has done more harm than good in parts of the world it has tried to help."}

On the Japanese side, let’s look at the results of a B-29 incendiary raid over Tokyo . Just one of these raids (of which there were a few) killed about 125,000 people. This suggests that two of these raids would have been equivalent to the total amount of casualties that resulted from the atomic bombs. In the Potsdam Declaration, the countries against Japan stated that if Japan didn’t surrender, it would face “prompt and utter destruction,” so it’s safe to say that if the war against Japan hadn’t ended when it did, there would have been more such raids.

(It also appealed to younger consumers by being cheaper than its rival.) In contrast, Coca-Cola has always represented itself as classic Americana , endearing itself to older, more traditional consumers, playing to their emotions , and promoting a reliable drink that goes well with any kind of food or company.

This data by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons reflects a deep imbalance in societal expectations upon aging women to appear young. Over the years, Hollywood has gone from criticizing to accepting those who get Botox without addressing the product’s primary assumption – that it is important for women to be young-looking. It is this assumption that entangles women in unrealistic standards that can often form into an unhealthy preoccupation with the body. Doctors and patients alike report the addictive nature of Botox treatments. Patients show up younger and younger for injections, complain more frequently about wrinkles, and, unsatisfied with their results, are more likely to seek more aggressive remedies to combat aging, including surgery. Aging women are not the only victims. Over one-third of girls report dissatisfaction with their bodies from age five.

Similarly, while most assume that all human cultures are violent, the anthropologist Douglas Fry has documented over 70 societies that don’t make war at all, from the Martu of Australia, who have no words for “feud” or “warfare,” to the Semai of Malaysia, who simply flee into the forest when faced with conflict."}

At the beginning of 2018, the NFL announced the formation of a social justice committee to assist NFL players with promoting social justice causes and awareness for them. The committee said it would spend $100 million trying to improve education, police and community relations and the criminal justice system in NFL cities. Plus, Stephen Ross, managing general partner of the Miami Dolphins, co-chairs a national non-profit aimed at educating and empowering the sports community to improve race relations and eliminate discrimination. Additionally, despite the criticism that Colin Kaepernick has garnered, he succeeded to create a space in which important national conversations about race could finally take place. In courageously speaking his conscience, he inspired a generation of athletes and teams – and younger fans – to speak out and peacefully address social issues. He also became a cause for activists and social rights within the NFL. In fact, Nike’s 2018 decision to use Kaepernick as their spokesman, especially with the tag line “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything” sends a big message to the NFL and its fans that freedom of speech and one’s conviction should be valued, not bullied or ignored. Fast forward to 2020, and the NFL has now admitted it was wrong in its response to Kaepernick and now supports his fight against racial injustice."}

Centuries of society’s preoccupation with youth argue that this trend is unlikely to change, and Botox helps people to gain a competitive edge in a youth-driven society while they age. Moreover, psychologists have shown most people harbor a cognitive bias called the Halo Effect , which induces them to believe that attractive people have other positive personality traits, like intelligence and kindness. If society deems youth attractive and equates attractiveness to goodness, then using Botox to achieve a youthful look isn’t vain – it’s prudent. There is even a growing trend among Millennials today to use Botox as a preventative measure to ward off aging before it even sets in. Given the rise of social media, Millennials may feel more pressured than previous generations to constantly look selfie-worthy – and this is where Botox can help. In fact, such preventative Botox procedures among 20-29-year-olds have increased 28% since 2010."}

They reportedly devote an average of six to nine hours in front of screens on a daily basis. At sleepaway camp, though, activities like rock climbing, day-long color wars and water fights make kids excited to unplug and get physically active. Even just walking across the large, open spaces of the campgrounds to get from one activity to the other gives kids exercise that they most likely don’t get all year round. Not to mention group singalongs and face-to-face activities, like drama, art, dance, music, etc., with other campers nurture socialization skills that often get rusty because of too much solitary screen time.

Moreover, centralized banks place important controls on interest rates and the influx of money into the economy, thereby controlling inflation and pricing, and helping national and international economies to mitigate financial downturns.

Over the last 20 years, teen birth rates across the United States have been continuously declining . According to Pew Research, the birth rate among 15- to 19-year-old females in 2018 was less than half of what it had been in 2008.

This version exploits her; for example, after her transition from Dr. Quinzel into Harley, the first time we hear her speak in the movie is when she’s working in a strip club and flirting with the Joker’s colleague. Her current costume consists of barely-there shorts and a tight-fitting crop top, which is a complete deviation from her original clown-like attire and more in line with the borderline pornographic portrayal of Harley in the 2009 video game Batman: Arkham Asylum .

The Montessori philosophy values industriousness, and these educational discoveries are even referred to as “work.” Furthermore, Montessori does not value imaginative play like make-believe (like pretending to be a chef or a dragon) or emphasize social interactions.

The quality and strength of Federer’s competition is unquestionable. In fact, it has been said that Federer’s skills forced his competitors to up their game just to be able to compete with him."}

While former Miss America 2013 Mallory Hagan expressed relief that the public could finally understand just how dehumanizing the culture had always been, former Miss America 1998 Kate Shindle told TODAY, “You can apologize for the bad words or the bad statements, but it’s so clear that there’s a pervasive culture of abuse.” Even after overhauling the management of the Miss America Organization following the 2017 scandal, complaints of abuse still apparently remain. Miss America 2018 Cara Mund has reported being bullied by new management, which is now composed of women."}

This is because once legalized, sports betting – and advertisements promoting it – will be monitored , and any irregular activity will be easily detected. It is easier to fix games in an unmonitored environment, in which money flows under the radar. Proof of such successful monitoring is the recent suspension of 5 NFL players who were caught violating the league’s gambling policy. Therefore, the common belief that legalizing sports betting will corrupt sports is wrong."}

According to the Washington Post , a review of Reddit’s ChangeMyMind forum revealed that people who remained polite and practiced hedging – a linguistic tool used to make an argument appear less threatening (“it may be that”) – succeeded more often in changing people’s minds. Another study determined that people are more likely to change their minds when they feel good about themselves. People who had practiced positive self-affirmation before entering an argument were more influenced by the argument than those who had only argued, without the benefit of the self-affirmation activity. Positivity opens the door to a flexible mind."}

In fact, research suggests that a lack of vitamin D may make you more vulnerable to illnesses, like Covid-19. There’s no better single source for all three of these nutrients than milk. (For the record, vitamin D is added to fortified milk). Plus, it also contains carbs, fats, proteins and other minerals, all of which are a must for growing children, not to mention for aging adults – and everyone in between. True, milk isn’t the only source of all of these needed nutrients.

Lance Armstrong and Tiger Woods are just a couple examples of professional athletes who are no longer seen as being role models for youngsters. Today, we know much more about our sports heroes’ lives, for better and for worse. This insight has contributed to the erosion of their status as heroes. As athletes’ statuses change, our attitudes toward them do as well. This has led to a growing public understanding and acceptance of athletes who use PEDs. Thus, our criteria for including baseball players in the National Baseball Hall of Fame has softened over the years , allowing for the inclusion of PED users.

As soy milk comes from plants, it naturally does not contain cholesterol and is low in saturated fat. Plus, fortified soy milk has as much as 299 mg of calcium per cup, which accounts for 23% of the daily value. It can also be fortified with vitamin D, for bone health. What’s more, soybeans also contain carbs called fructooligosaccharides , which nourish our bodies’ supportive intestinal bacteria, important for digestion. In addition, since soybeans have an extremely low glycemic index , they are slow to trigger our bodies’ insulin response. This ensures more stable blood sugar, which means fewer mood swings."}

Worse than that, some of the children even showed a negative learning outcome – meaning they came out of the zoo with “facts” that were actually fictional. In addition, zoos may even have a negative impact on visitors, showing them that it is okay to hold animals in captivity."}

California, the current gold standard of redistricting, gave the job to its non-partisan citizens rather than the state Legislature in 2008; this generated many more competitive districts in the area and incorporated public feedback into every aspect of the district maps.

In The Little Mermaid, King Triton’s use of his magic triton is portrayed as benevolent and good. Yet, in the hands of a woman (Ursula), it is unequivocally evil and wreaks havoc in the order of the natural world, as expressed through the storm she conjures. Even female protagonists with magical powers like Rapunzel and Elsa are considered dangerous and locked away.

Since the Supreme Court decision, states have been more inclined to consider or pass legislation to legalize sports betting, thus allowing people to continue betting but in a regulated and fairer environment. This has prevented betters from having to deal with questionable bookies. Moreover, betting addicts now have fewer stigmas, which may make it easier for them to seek help."}

However, there may be other factors that account for its success. Here are a couple such factors to consider: The business world at large, and the hi-tech sector specifically, are characterized by leaders who come from one of two backgrounds: business or technology. For these analytical minds, excel makes more sense than a creative hunch. A spreadsheet displaying CTR (click through rates) percentage over time is something they easily ‘get’; hence, they welcome performance marketing. In other words, digital marketing is their default choice – not because it’s necessarily better than traditional marketing but because it’s more familiar. This is also true for marketing agencies. With digital marketing, you have the playbook pretty much written before the client enters. The crucial know-how (CPC, CPA, CTR, etc.) relates to the media, not to the specific product. This is very different from traditional advertising, where you have to tailor a new suit for each creative challenge. Also, with digital marketing, it’s much easier to guarantee a 2-5 percent improvement year over year, which keeps the client happy."}

He has great tactical intelligence, finding free spaces to move into, receiving the ball and then laying it off to a team-mate, to build attacks. While Ronaldo is more of an executor, who plays high up the pitch and scores great goals when given the chance, Messi, who can do that just as well, is also comfortable dropping deep and keeping possession of the ball with his team. From these positions, he can send his colleagues on dangerous runs with pin-point passes, like he did in the 2022 World Cup game against Croatia .

This is because people automatically think that the shifting or redrawing of Congressional boundaries create a homogeneous district that will lead to blowouts for one party or the other. However, gerrymandering is not the culprit: geographical self-sorting is. A study examining America’s partisan divide found growing evidence of polarity among citizens across counties, states and regions. For example, there was an 8% increase in polarization between 2008 and 2012, irrespective of redistricting changes. In other words, Americans themselves are becoming more extreme in their political views, and are, therefore, voting in more extreme candidates. Diversity within each party is sharply narrowing; the Pew Research Center identified a widening gap between Democrats and Republicans on a number of values, up by 21% from 1994. Gerrymandering may highlight America’s growing polarization and thus, its lack of an ideological middle, but it is certainly not the cause."}

In fact, a number of factors outside the president’s control likely played a greater role, from Federal Reserve policy to the financial distress of government agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac – which the Bush administration repeatedly warned Congress about and called for reforms, which were ignored. However, one Bush decision did prevent the recession from turning into a crippling depression. The Troubled Asset Relief Program was unpopular, and concerns over the moral hazard of bailing out banks are understandable. But without the bailout, the recession would have been deeper and longer .

Not to mention, he refused to treat people unless they could pay him , which meant by default that he was only servicing a certain, i.e., wealthy, portion of society, thus limiting his exposure to issues. Freud’s focus on sexual explanations for psychological incidents has been seen as simplistic.

In one study, if the Candoshi were shown a red chip on a ceramic surface, they usually described it with a word that means “like ripe fruit.” But if the same chip was on the floor, people more often deemed it to be “like blood.” Perhaps these words aren’t really color terms at all. Likewise, a linguist has argued that the Warlpiri people of Australia have no color talk .

After being accused of sexual harassment by three different women, two of whom were former aides, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo was criticized for his apology because it focused more on his alleged actions having been misinterpreted instead of the alleged actions themselves. This can make it seem like the public apology has turned into an appeal for sympathy. Take, for instance, Kevin Spacey’s statement in 2017 addressing allegations that he molested then-14-year-old actor Anthony Rapp. His non-apology opened by claiming not to remember the incident, distancing himself off the bat. He closed with the revelation that he is now committed to living a homosexual lifestyle.

Not to mention the harm his statement caused to the LGBTQ community, who have been fighting the stigma of pedophilia for decades. Disingenuous apologies that read as excuses are merely excuses."}

The subsequent (if delayed) $900 billion pandemic relief bill signed at the end of 2020 and President Biden’s promise of additional economic relief in the coming year are also noteworthy.

In reality, homeowners spend exorbitant amounts of money on interest: For instance, a $300,000 mortgage at the standard interest rate of 3.5% will cost nearly $ 653,000 over thirty years. And this is to say nothing of the hundreds of thousands of dollars that homeowners spend on property taxes, home repairs, and upgrades that do not necessarily add to the value of the house. Investors and economists agree that this capital is better spent on products with a higher return on investment."}

Nobel Prizes are just one way to measure. In 2009, 40 percent of articles published in biomedical journals came from the US, three times as many as its nearest competitor. And more than 40 percent of new drugs are developed in America. Were the US to abandon its private sector model, the country and the wider world would lose out on this innovation."}

The franchise’s first installment became one of the biggest blockbusters ever, not just because so many people went to see the movie, but also because so many fans went to see it over and over again. It was also the first movie that created merchandise mania , a craze to follow many summer movies in the years to come. Sources say that even George Lucas didn’t believe his movie would be such a success. On the evening of the movie’s premiere, he didn’t even bother to attend. Instead, he was in Hawaii with his best friend Steven Spielberg, brainstorming an idea for another movie. That movie was Raiders of the Lost Ark."}

Couples in open relationships tend to be more self-aware and honest with themselves about their own sexual desires because they have the freedom to explore them. Therefore, they are very open and honest when sharing their experiences – and maybe even more transparent to their partners, which enhances their communication . Monogamy, on the other hand, may hinder this type of open communication, as the structure of the relationship doesn’t carry as much of a push to be forthcoming with one another."}

People in the US will casually follow a World Cup in droves, only to go back to watching football or basketball during the season. The fact that the US didn’t qualify for the 2018 World Cup made Americans even less interested in the tournament. Sources say that an average of almost 3.59 million viewers watched the World Cup 2022 on Fox, an increase of 30% over 2018 viewership on the channel. While impressive, the question remains about what sport they returned to watching after the tournament ended. It’s too soon to tell how many US sports fans will tune in to watch the Women’s 2023 World Cup – and if that will make a difference to the future of the sport.

Many Holocaust deniers overlook the overwhelming evidence of the Holocaust, and without survivors to contradict them, the tragedy of the Holocaust is in danger of being minimized. For example, in Poland, a controversial bill was signed into law in February 2018 that advocates for criminalizing the mention of Poland’s role in the Holocaust , which may eventually erase the Holocaust from Polish history. Without mandatory Holocaust education, it would be too easy for the world to forget or even deny what happened."}

International coalition forces like NATO are in place to judge, admonish or respond to a country’s aggressions, case in point Russia’s invasions of Ukraine , Crimea and Georgia over the past decade.

For example, diet (namely intake of caffeine, artificial sweeteners, and preservatives), sleep deprivation, and stress contribute to hyperactivity and irritability that can masquerade as ADHD . A study which found that children in foster care are three times as likely to be diagnosed with ADHD also supports the notion that ADHD diagnosis may have more to do with environmental factors than the actual presence of the disorder."}

No materials are needed to build walls or separate areas into cubicles. No individual desks need to be purchased, and the space can easily be reconfigured as required. Again, before the current health pandemic changed how we think about working alongside others , an open floor plan often enabled more employees to work in a single space, enabling a better value for the cost of the company’s office rental. This way, companies could invest more money into business operations and rewarding employee achievements instead of into office construction and maintenance. Who knows, maybe the money saved on office planning could have been used to fund company fun days or other morale-boosting events."}

Researchers at Harvard have found that open work environments negatively affect collaboration, actually reducing face-to-face interactions by 70%. Plus, fewer screens or walls between employees, can lead to increased employee interruption, reduced levels of concentration and lower levels of motivation.

The republicans are not alone in taking money from fossil fuel companies. The Democratic National Committee has also accepted donations from such companies.

After the deadly mass shooting in Las Vegas in October 2017, the Trump administration banned bump stocks , a device that lets semi-automatic rifles function like machine guns. So while banning the purchase of such technology, magazines or assault weapons won’t prevent gun crime from happening, it will greatly reduce the carnage."}

After all, research from Brigham Young University demonstrates that social isolation is a risk factor for having a shorter life, in ways that are comparable to obesity .

In December 2012, during Operation Pillar of Defense , Netanyahu resisted calls from within his government to launch a ground invasion . In the summer of 2014, Netanyahu did invade Gaza but stopped short of overthrowing Hamas and reoccupying the enclave, as some right-wing Israelis hoped. While Netanyahu showed similar restraint in 2012 when he decided against a military strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities, he has since (and sporadically) engaged in targeted military strikes of Iranian-backed terror bases in Syria, aimed at preventing Hezbollah from attacking Israel.

For example, in 2008, the U.S. housing bubble popped , leading to an economic crisis , which became the Great Recession. In this vein, whenever Bitcoin prices drop, experts warn that they will only continue to fall , especially in the long run, even after temporary recoveries. Also, Bitcoin takes money and power away from institutions that are used to being in charge – namely, banks and governments.

It is hard to focus on West as an artist when he is foraying into politics, religion and health – and, some say, in uninformed or irresponsible ways . For many, West’s greatest album is My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy , which was released in 2010; since then, it seems that Kanye is very busy trying to convince people he is amazing, rather than just letting his music do so. The latest backlash that West is receiving from fellow artists regarding his recent anti-Black and anti-Semitic hate speech is sending a message that perhaps West the person should stay silent for a while and let his past music speak for itself."}

Even through a flat tax , under which the rich pay the same tax rate as lower earners, the wealthy will still end up paying more in absolute terms since they have a higher amount of income to tax. But by any reasonable definition, the amount paid by the rich is already beyond their “fair share .” For example, in 2015, the top 1 percent earned 16.5 percent of income, but paid a staggering 43.6 percent of federal income tax.

When victims of sexual harassment or assault come forward with their claims, like the women who came forward against Harvey Weinstein or Bill Cosby , among others, they put themselves on the line with no guarantee of closure. For some of these victims, feelings of loss of control and self are all common symptoms of trauma. Recovery can take a lifetime, but a public apology has the potential to diffuse the feelings of helplessness caused by sexual assault trauma and provide closure.

He is simply a better fit for today’s game. His athleticism is second to none; he combines dizzying pace with powerful shooting and jumping ability of an NBA star, which makes his headers a serious threat to the opposition.

Other researchers have found elevated levels of CO2 in the bloodstreams of those who had out-of-body sensations – which has been linked to visual hallucinations. Similar to the effect of hallucinogenic drugs , these sensations may be created by the chemical changes , sometimes drug-related , happening in a body on the brink of death. Unfortunately, the “white light” some claim to see happens only in our minds: Death, sadly, is what’s at the end of the tunnel."}

In contrast, Black Lives Matter seems to imply that Black Lives may matter more than those of other lives. It could even create more harm than good by giving the impression that to Black activists, non-Black lives matter less. Politics have also become entwined in the movement, distracting from its cause. For instance, some BLM activists have been accused of espousing anti-Semitic sentiments in the media and/or on social media, instead of speaking up for Black civil liberties. If the BLM were to embrace the #AllLivesMatter slogan, it would show that they care for all minorities, who would then be less cautious about embracing their cause."}

For example, you may not know if a company you’ve invested in is about to hire a new CEO whose decisions will ultimately drive the price of their stocks down. On the other hand, you can choose where to buy your property, how much you want to renovate it, who you want to rent to, and how much to invest in the upkeep; all of which can determine how good your investment is. In other words, the ability to profit from your real estate investment lies in your hands."}

Of 100 participants, half were selected at random to receive Botox injections, and the other half were administered a placebo treatment. Both Botox-treated patients and those who only received placebos reported improved body image, self-esteem, and overall physical health. This lends weight to the argument that the proactive nature of Botox treatments leads to better overall self-care, which promotes overall wellness."}

Unfortunately, the opposite holds true as well; most recent grads don’t land their dream jobs right after school, and it can be difficult to transition to a different career path you may like more once you gain experience (and adopt the mindset) in that initial field. This is a common recipe for job burnout , with studies linking work stress to physical and emotional health disturbances. If starting your business means doing what you love, then it easily trumps settling into a job you may not want. As the saying goes: Build your own dreams, or someone else will hire you to build theirs."}

When picking Russell, the Raiders could have chosen Calvin Johnson, who was a great option and was considered as one of the most dynamic receivers in the league for a decade. Potential future Hall of Famers Joe Thomas (who is in the College Football Hall of Fame ), Adrian Peterson and Patrick Willis were alternative choices for Russell. The Chargers’ choice of Leaf is more understandable. During the 1998 draft, the Chargers needed a QB. They preferred Peyton Manning (who is considered one of the best QB of all times), but he was chosen first by the Colts. The Chargers were left with Leaf, who was then considered around the same level as Manning . So, the Raiders had better options and yet made the worst choice, which makes Russell a bigger bust."}

While each of these characters is out of step with their surroundings, their exceptionality eventually leads to greatness. Mulan becomes a warrior who prevents an invasion; Belle finds love and happiness without compromising; Remy becomes a gourmet chef; and Bruno’s vision propels Mirabel, the story’s protagonist, to ultimately save her family. Disney’s outcasts challenge society’s norms and invite young viewers to challenge them as well. Many Disney movies also directly or indirectly promote lessons of tolerance, showing that it can be rewarding to accept others for who they are, even – or especially – if they are different."}

{"id": 746, "content": "The vast majority of us have three types of light receptors in our eyes, called cones , that are optimized to detect different colors or wavelengths of light. While our vision is complicated, generally speaking, these cones are optimized to see red, green and blue light; the brain combines this information to perceive color. With these three cones, most people can distinguish millions of distinct shades. There are a few exceptions, of course. There are a variety of types of color blindness, usually affecting men, where one or more of these cones is missing or mutated, often making it hard to tell green from red. On the Pacific Island of Pingelap , a shocking 10% of people are completely color blind. On the other hand, some women have an extra type of cone, giving them “super” color vision . These exceptions aside, the vast majority of humans have the same basic perceptual abilities."}

This devaluation promotes an overall casual attitude towards marriage , leading people to enter marriages lightly and without due consideration; they know they can always obtain a divorce if the marriage doesn’t work out instead of fighting for the survival of the relationship."}

His touch turned the flailing Boston Celtics into a real fighting force, the only team to ever win eight consecutive NBA championships. He valued defense over offense. By focusing on breaking up the opposition’s plays, his teams punished them with counterattacks. Auerbach emphasized teamwork, drilling his players to form a cohesive unit that dominated other teams all over the court.

His dribbling is considered to be the best the game has ever seen, and he passes and shoots the ball with the precision of a brain surgeon.

The plan launched with an initial $15 billion over five years, way above any existing US commitments, and provided life-saving drugs to more than two million Africans by the time Bush left office.

Proof of this is the Academy Awards recognizing actress Cynthia Erivo portraying Harriet Tubman’s story in 2020 and the fact that South Korean film Parasite won that year’s Oscar for Best Picture. Hollywood is known for taking chances on such diverse stories, even if they broach sensitive matters of race. In 1977, when television’s black viewership was only 10%, ABC produced and screened Roots , a miniseries featuring a mostly black cast, depicting several generations of an American slave family. Beyond being a hit, the show generated nationwide conversation about the uncomfortable realities of America’s history and present. In that vein, where compelling stories are what drive broadcasting decisions, entertainment journalist Nellie Andreeva writes that the success of television’s ethnically diverse programming is the power of each show’s premise – Empire, Transparent , Cristela, and Issa Rae’s Insecure succeeded not because they are directed toward diverse and/or ethic audiences, but because they draw audiences into new worlds with compelling stories and characters."}

When Portugal decriminalized all drugs, the country’s drug abuse rates were cut in half and there was no increase in use of weed or any other substance. Still today, rates of drug use in the country remain below the EU average . Other drug-tolerant nations, like the Netherlands, show significantly lower rates of lifetime and occasional marijuana use. One year after Colorado legalized recreational pot use for adults, a survey of 17,000 high school students showed a decline in teen marijuana use. The rate is still on the downswing even as of 2021. It seems marijuana legalization may have stripped the drug of its rebellious appeal and returned Colorado teens to other means of weekend thrills."}

{"id": 766, "content": "Countless studies have revealed the discouraging truth that people don’t often allow facts to intervene in their worldview. This is because belief and opinion are often tied to identity. For example, Christians organize their ethics and actions around the teachings of Jesus. So, when someone challenges a core Christian belief (how did Jesus walk on water?), they are not just challenging an idea, but the foundation upon which a person has built her life. Given that views and identity are linked on the major issues (which differ from one person to another), it is unsurprising that many people will double-down on a certain belief when a fact challenges their worldview. For example, white nationalists, eager to prove their Aryan bona fides, have started utilizing genetic testing services to verify their “whiteness.” When their results show that their ancestry is not exclusively white, instead of abandoning their belief in their whiteness (and in white superiority), they question the validity of the tests."}

Moreover, technology might be ahead of us. It`s possible that while you’re reading these lines, there are new technologies available that can provide referees with the right call through the use of replays, before they even ask for it.

Having smaller, closed offices with fewer people may be particularly relevant and beneficial to offices that have been enforcing social distancing rules. Not to mention, with less shared office space also means fewer shared office supplies and physical interactions, an obvious plus when it comes to social distancing and lowering the risk of exposure to germs. Physical health aside, closed office space also improves employees’ emotional wellbeing, as they are less exposed to work-related stressors, including the need to appear in constant productivity. Indeed, it’s been suggested that employees working in closed offices tend to experience less age discrimination due to the exhibition of anxiety, cardiac issues and digestive problems caused by the stressful environment they are working in. These employees also experience less neurological problems, like vertigo, brought on by the busy open-space environment."}

A more recent example is Bill Cosby, whose contribution to television and the positive portrayal of African American families is immeasurable. However, he was found guilty in his retrial of aggravated indecent assault for drugging and sexually assaulting a woman at his Philadelphia home in 2004.

That’s when Colin Kaepernick first sat during the national anthem to protest ongoing police brutality and the overall oppression of black people in America. Faster than you can say “Hut!” his sitting turned into kneeling, which turned into sustained (and often vitriolic ) nationwide debates about race, police brutality, 1st amendment rights, and patriotism. NFL coaches, managers, sponsors and even two US presidents all weighed in, for better or for worse. Controversy continued even after the NFL passed a revised policy that mandates that players on the sidelines must stand for the national anthem or otherwise wait in the locker room. Fast forward to 2020, post-George Floyd riots (or, more accurately, because of them), and we see a more accepting, more socially and racially sensitive NFL . However, before arriving at this more compassionate and socially aware cornerstone, a 2017 nationwide poll showed that 19% of professional football fans lost interest in the NFL. Among them, 24% said political issues caused them to turn away, with 17% specifically blaming Kaepernick and his national anthem protest. For many , NFL games – and post-game analyses – no longer provide an escape from draining politics but have turned into an unwelcome extension of it."}

In general, drone strikes cost far less in human life than other kinds of warfare. This is owing to drone strikes’ precision. Whereas airplanes must quickly fire their weapons and depart the area, drones can hover above their targets for several hours, providing real-time surveillance that allows operators to detect non-combatants and wait for them to evacuate before firing. Additionally, drone weaponry is significantly smaller than those used in airstrikes. Their small blast radius safeguards against collateral damage, and they even have features that allow a misfire to be quickly corrected. A Slate report found that traditional forms of warfare, including airstrikes, missiles and ground operations kill around three times as many civilians as drone strikes."}

Many of Liang’s supporters shouted, “All Lives Matter,” claiming that he was a scapegoat because he was not white and that he should not be jailed. However, Black activists pointed out that Liang was tried by a jury of his peers and deserved to be jailed for his actions. Using “All Lives Matter” to demand freedom for someone who was convicted of murdering an unarmed Black man is nothing more than demanding that white privilege be extended to all people of color except for Black Americans."}

A study by the Federal Reserve Bank showed that there’s a “revolving door” between financial executives and government regulators, meaning that regulators can easily become part of the private sectors that they oversee, simply by switching jobs. With the amount of money flowing through Wall Street, it’s easy to see how lobbyists can sway government policy to reflect their best interests. Democracy is supposed to be immune to wealth (or lack thereof), yet with the millions allocated from Wall Street pockets towards lobbying in Washington, that’s clearly not the case."}
{"id": 786, "content": "While acknowledging some negatives, it is important not to overlook the tremendous benefits NAFTA has brought to Americans. Access to Mexican and Canadian markets is essential for US manufacturers; with just 4.4 percent of the world’s population, American innovators cannot be restricted to trading within US borders. Canada and Mexico are the top destinations for US exports, with around $500 billion of American goods flowing to the country’s two NAFTA partners. Exports to Mexico alone have risen from $43 billion in 1993 to $243 billion. Without NAFTA, US businesses would be less competitive . As far as Mexican imports, increased competition lowers prices for Americans. This not only helps consumers, who essentially receive a raise when their purchasing power increases, but benefits American manufacturers who now have access to cheaper component parts."}

The Olympics celebrate history and the values of freedom, equality, globalism and peace. As the Olympics are about this very spirit — and not about money — promoting these values should be the first consideration for hosting, not money. A host city not only identifies and supports these values but gets the honor to promote them locally and globally. Hosting is also a great opportunity for cities to introduce themselves to the rest of the world – as future travel destinations. Such a positive environment (not to mention infrastructure) will remain even after the Olympic Games end."}

These tendencies to publicly pit women against each other , criticize their art, or refer to them as “b*tches” shows a lack of respect and grace for other women in the industry. More importantly, it is damaging to women as a whole, because Minaj is setting an example to others that breaking down camaraderie instead of strengthening it gets you attention."}

The women of the Bible are deceitful, cunning, and sometimes, just plain mean. Abraham’s wife Sarah bids him to have a child with her handmaid, only to turn mother and child out when Sarah has her own child. Rebecca tricks her blind husband into giving her favorite son, Jacob, a birthright he was not meant to have. Tamar tricks her father-in-law, Judah, into sleeping with her. Delilah goads her lover, Samson, into revealing his secret weakness, which she reports to his enemies, costing him his eyes and his life. These tales seem to decree women incapable of obedience, measured judgment, or loyalty; it’s a wonder God commanded man to procreate with woman at all."}
{"id": 790, "content": "A 2013 study found that employees working in cubicles had “the highest rates of unhappiness with their work set-up.” Open office spaces , on the other hand, tend to be more disposed to spontaneous brainstorming sessions and informal group conversation. This is, in part, what contributed to the rise of WeWork , the global chain of shared office spaces that transformed the way startups interacted with one another before its sudden decline in 2019. In spaces like WeWork offices , the improved communication that resulted from a lack of physical barriers enabled employees to collaborate freely – bounce ideas off of each other and ask for assistance, as needs arose. Such fluid communication enabled workers to establish relationships with their colleagues and create an atmosphere of greater teamwork and fulfillment. Ditching the concept of corner offices can also help those in management positions stay more connected to company culture and employees’ mindset."}

Rather than attributing Arsenal’s achievements to Wenger’s coaching abilities, they should be attributed to the great vision and fantastic work of the board, led mostly by Vice-Chairman David Dean. When Wenger didn’t want to pay more than £8M for Sylvain Wiltord, Dean recruited him for £13M, and Wiltord eventually became an Arsenal star, playing a huge role in the club’s 2001/2002 Premier League victory. It was Dean’s persistence that brought in the star players who made Arsenal so great. Tony Adams, an Arsenal legend and captain, once said: “ Coaching wasn’t Arsène’s strong point .” Wenger’s strength wasn’t in on-field coaching but in identifying and nurturing young talent."}

(In New York, attendance in 2018 hit 250,000 ). Comic books, fantasy and sci-fi novels, and the “geeks” or “nerds” who were once teased for reading them are now all considered popular . While this embrace of the fringe is positive, some think that it has negatively impacted Comic-Con itself. The event is getting increasingly mainstream and watered down , which disappoints die-hard comic book fans. More Hollywood and TV stars are coming to promote their big movies and shows (even virtually ), in turn attracting crowds addicted to celebrity rather than comic books. For example, in Comic-Con 2018, controversy surrounding Johnny Depp and ex-wife Amber Heard’s simultaneous panel appearances garnered more attention than, say, the work of the talented group of comic book creators under age 15 . Conventions are now more of a media blitz for movie studios and television producers to market their latest superhero movies and fantasy shows rather than a genuine celebration of the art form (although, HBO and Marvel did choose to sit out the 2018 San Diego convention, and 2019 also had a modest studio attendance )."}
{"id": 794, "content": "When school uniforms are mandatory, parents incur the added expense of clothing that their children will have no use for outside of school. They still need to buy regular clothes for their children to wear after hours, on the weekends and for casual dress days. For parents who would have sent their children to school in hand-me-downs or hand-crafted garments, as well as for parents banking on free public education, forking out funds for school uniforms can be unaffordable and disconcerting. Not to mention that there are cases where siblings from low-income families have had to share uniforms, which has forced them to attend school on alternate days. While this may be a rare example, less rare is the reality that worn-out and tattered hand-me-down uniforms may inspire bullying, which school uniforms are trying to prevent. So, the very concept that is meant to even the playing field can actually divide it."}

By definition, jail is a loss of freedom, and this threat is enhanced when it includes the loss of democratic rights as well.

These protests could be credited for prompting swift legal action that allowed many visa-holders to remain in the country. In 2018, teachers throughout West Virginia went on strike during a nine-day protest that resulted in a 5% increase in pay – not to mention it inspired additional teacher strikes in other states. And the teenage survivors of the Parkland high school shooting in 2018 created a national discussion and movement that held government officials and businesses accountable and resulted in states passing 50 new gun-control laws."}

Women’s soccer aside, after Beckham, stars such as Ricardo Kaká, Thierry Henry, Steven Gerrard and now Lionel Messi have crossed the Atlantic. Such arrivals, coupled with significant investment in new stadiums, have increased the number of Americans attending games. With the establishment of new clubs in LA, Atlanta, Minnesota and Miami, among others, and further investment in big-name players and modern stadiums, soccer’s emergence as one of America’s top sports may still happen, especially with 16 American cities set to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup."}

Hate speech is violent by nature and can cause direct and indirect physical and psychological harm. Professor Lisa Feldman Barrett of Northeastern University took a scientific approach to understand how hate speech affects the human brain. She explained that “if words can cause stress, and if prolonged stress can cause physical harm, then certain types of speech can be a form of violence.” Words also create an atmosphere that incites physical harm, as evidenced in the systematic murdering of millions at the hands of the Nazis, made possible after propaganda laid the groundwork for hate. Some offensive remarks may seem harmless, but they can snowball into more volatile forms. Once speech reaches an extreme, it becomes too late to avoid its dangerous consequences."}

This might be stating the obvious since its basketball we`re talking about, but the more you think about it, the more you understand how being airborne makes everything harder. It’s not just their jumping ability; basketball players also need to be agile, creative and demonstrate flexibility while in mid-air , especially since, most of the time, there’s a ginormous center jumping between them and the basket. They also need to aim and score, block shots and make physical contact, all within seconds while off the ground, when they’re most vulnerable."}

There is an overwhelming amount of evidence that she has a strong sense of compassion and loyalty for the people in her life, as opposed to the Joker, who will abuse anything and anyone to get what he wants. For example, she won’t fight the Black Canary when the Canary is pregnant, and she helps bring a broken family together in one of the Harley Quinn Holiday Special comics. While not without fault, her moral sides can’t be ignored, which makes it much more difficult to condemn her character."}

Most people from a given culture tend to be similar in their distinctions, perhaps making more groupings in the blue region, or in the red. But cultures differ from each other. Sometimes the groupings are completely foreign to what Westerners might expect. For instance, when the Jahai of the Malay Peninsula were asked to group color chips, they divided them up conceptually: red and blue went together, for example, because “husband and wife go together,” they explained."}

However, by inspiring people to focus on health over beauty standards, BoPo uses language that strips away stereotypes, creating a more accepting and inclusive society. It separates weight from health, body image from self-worth. The movement recognizes the stigma around different body types as weighing us down as a society and tries to alter it for the better."}

This kind of disorder needs immediate treatment, which antidepressants can’t provide. While antidepressants may be helpful in the long run, they don’t work fast enough. While it can take anywhere from six weeks to six months for antidepressants to take effect, newer generations of SSRIs take about three weeks – which is still way too long to wait for someone who’s feeling desperate and seeking professional help. Taking a pill for weeks without feeling a change may discourage a depressed person from continuing treatment or seeking further help. In contrast, seeing a therapist or implementing other lifestyle and behavioral changes into their daily routine may bring about quicker results."}

Therefore, homework assignments serve as a positive and productive way to bring parents and children together. Homework gives them an opportunity to be supportive about what their kids are learning. Plus, even if parents aren’t directly involved in a particular homework assignment, sitting next to their child and doing their own “homework,” in the form of paying bills, working or planning the week’s meals, can also serve as a model of support and quality bonding for the child. It also shows that doing homework is an early start to meeting lifelong responsibilities."}

Sources say that the combined VR and AR markets were expected to reach $18.8 billion in 2020 , up from $10.5 billion in 2019. Nowadays, amid the pandemic, VR has become vital technology for the survival of retail .

According to the Pew Research Center, 57% of Americans feel that people today are too easily offended by what others say.

While PC culture claims to want to include everyone, calling someone out for using a “problematic” term or demanding that they adopt your speech norms is not only alienating and belittling, but a display of social cultural superiority . After all, the most reliable determinants for someone’s support of political correctness is their advantageous education and income . So is this kind of sensitivity actually doing anything for minorities or is it just the virtue signaling of the already-privileged?"}
{"id": 812, "content": "Paid maternity leave can reinforce stereotyped gender roles in a way that’s harmful to both women and men. If only women are paid to stay at home with their new baby, it strengthens the assumption that it’s solely a woman’s job to care for the children and look after the house. It reinforces the expectation that men aren’t interested in spending time with their children. Today, many men want to be hands-on fathers and look forward to spending time caring for their infants and small children. However, without paid paternal leave, they barely get a chance to see their babies on a working day. More and more research has come to light that shows long-term benefits of paternity leave for fathers, children and families. So, in addition to them missing out on bonding with their babies, as the wage gap increases because of maternity leave, fathers will only have to work harder to make up for their partner’s drop in pay."}

His many domestic reforms – such as tax cuts and expansion of property rights – further provided Russia with the stability it was looking for.

CBT is a talking form of therapy, so patients with certain emotional difficulties might feel a lack of emotional containment throughout the process.

But the democratic experiment did not last long. In July 2013, Morsi was ousted in a military coup by current President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. While some pointed to autocratic tendencies in Morsi himself, Sisi has overseen a level of oppression exceeding that of the Mubarak era.

He can create a shooting opportunity for himself in every position but will happily pass the ball if his teammate has a better shot. In contrast, Kobe was thought of by many as a selfish player , who hurt his team’s harmony, as was pointed out in the Phil Jackson biography . Kobe was ambitious but also arrogant in a way that led him to make bad on-court choices more than once. In contrast, LeBron’s teamwork and leadership shined after he joined the Cleveland Cavaliers, taking them to four playoffs in his first four years. His leadership skills have since gotten stronger since joining the LA Lakers in July 2018. Lifting up one’s team is the mark of a great player."}

The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a sandwich as “two or more slices of bread or a split roll having a filling in between.” And while describing a wiener as “filling” might seem a bit awkward, it is the generic nature of the term “filling” that allows for such wondrous variety in sandwiches. “Filling” means freedom – the freedom to make bread a most versatile canvas – for peanut butter, egg salad, and even hotdogs. So, is a hotdog a sandwich? In 2017, Oscar-Mayer’s head of marketing, Gregory Guidotti , declared it so, and even the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg ruled that a hotdog is a sandwich."}

Previously a stable country with a strong, though repressive, central government , Syria has become the defining humanitarian crisis of the 21st century. Close to 500,000 people have died already, and the war has no end in sight. In Libya, the uprising launched in 2011 deposed strongman Muammar Gaddafi after more than 40 years in power. But what followed was the rise of armed militias and instability, with the country’s future cohesion still very much in doubt .

Protests like the Women’s March on Washington as well as Parkland high schoolers against gun violence and pro-immigration protests saw participation of individuals who are unaffected by the core grievances of women, victims of school shootings and immigrants. Why? Because people’s identities are governed as much by their values as they are by their color, class, age and education. Case in point: The 2019 protests in Hong Kong against China’s encroaching influence inspired solidarity protests in the United States and elsewhere around the world. More recently, people of all races, colors and religions protested across America and the world against police brutality.

One might be wiser to pursue an activity with a better return on investment than crowd-sleuthing. Moreover, crowd-sleuthing could be used for vengeance instead of virtue, even leading to the spread of conspiracy theories or information that should not be in the public domain . In 2019, supporters of former President Donald Trump launched an online crowd-sleuthing effort to identify the Ukraine whistleblower who instigated Trump’s first impeachment. The subsequent public naming of a CIA operative could have led to broader national security consequences."}

He sought to fend off the rise of a non-democratic country to global economic supremacy by implementing tariffs and other trade regulations on China and the decline of America’s industrial activities by withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership . He openly questioned the legitimacy of NATO’s contribution structure, catalyzing reforms that will see the US shouldering less of the financial and human resource burdens of protecting European member-states. Trump also implemented policies, however controversial, that slowed illegal immigration into America. In being unafraid to reevaluate every contract, even those with longstanding partners, Trump drove the message that America expects fair terms and accountability."}

In 2011, Obama walked back from his now infamous “red line” on chemical weapons, and decided not to directly intervene in Syria; a year later, a sarin gas attack by Syrian forces killed 1400 innocents. Failure to provide deterrence emboldened not only the Assad regime (leading to over half a million deaths and the century’s largest refugee crisis) but Putin as well, who found little opposition to his illegal annexation of the Ukraine’s Crimea region. With Russia unchecked, Iran has already expanded its regional influence . While refusal to supply political clout to pressing world issues undermined American international supremacy, more shocking was how Obama’s policy of non-intervention ran counter to his many bold appeals to human rights, casting doubt that his statements were little more than abstract niceties that he never intended to defend."}

After all, who doesn’t love listening to familiar songs? That being said, despite knowing most of the songs, the show doesn’t feel like a “jukebox musical” whose storyline has been bent to fit specific songs.

It appears that members of religious communities are happier than non-believers, in part because they form a society of greater mutual support and care. Religion also extends beyond borders and, solely driven by its overarching belief in compassion, can motivate multi-religious action and community mobilization to help those in need.

Before women got the vote , anti-suffragists argued that women didn’t even want to vote and that it would simply make the election process more costly and unwieldy. Before the GOP was formed to promote abolition, people worried that the end of slavery would devastate the cotton and tobacco trades.

Instead, this money is currently going towards student assessments, and taking away essential resources from which students would highly benefit. Additionally, tests like the SATs may be biased towards those students who come from money; if they can afford to go to an expensive school or prep course, and if they have more time to study because they don’t have to work, then they will most likely perform better on such tests."}

{"id": 829, "content": "While vaccinations aren’t 100% foolproof, the rewards definitely outweigh the possible side effects , which, if they occur, are usually mild and temporary. For example, vaccinating your child against the flu can reduce his or her risk of flu-associated death by 51% among children with underlying high-risk medical conditions and by nearly 65% among healthy children. In contrast, an unvaccinated child can contract a disease that is vaccine-preventable, such as measles . Also, keep in mind that unvaccinated children can catch vaccine-preventable diseases from other kids or people who don’t even show any symptoms. For instance, Hib meningitis can be spread from people who have the bacteria in their bodies but aren’t even sick. As you can’t tell who in your surroundings is contagious , vaccinating your kids, especially against the regular flu , gives you one less thing to worry about in a world of unforeseen risks."}

In fact, while it has damaged the American economy, its impact has arguably been worse south of the border. Mexican farmers have been particularly hard hit , struggling to compete with highly subsidized American produce, including corn. Wages have dropped dramatically, as 1.1 million small farmers lost work in the first 12 years of NAFTA. Today, the average Mexican earns less money than before NAFTA—one of the reasons illegal immigration to the United States nearly tripled in the pact’s first 20 years. The new NAFTA deal promises to boost wages in Mexico and improve that country’s outdated labor laws and questionable labor union practices."}

The current system provides government-sponsored health care for the poor and elderly through Medicare and Medicaid . Meanwhile, most workers in large corporations receive health care as part of their compensation as required under Obamacare . The people left behind are those between jobs, those working for small businesses and those looking to start or grow their own small business. Government-provided health care would make it easier for entrepreneurs to leave their jobs and start their own businesses, since they would not be putting their families’ health care at risk. It would make it easier to hire workers early on, since employees would be more willing to take a risk working at a new firm knowing that health care is provided. And if the business takes off, it would no longer face the threat of the employer mandate once it crosses a certain threshold, which Obamacare set at 50 workers."}

Given that different people have different sensitivities, once you permit any censorship, you don’t know where it will end. Besides, the standards of moral decency change over the centuries.

The directing, casting and production choices in The Room inspire conversation to this day, inside and outside classrooms. The total freedom that writer, director, producer and star of The Room , Tommy Wiseau, had while filming is not seen outside of university projects, usually due to lack of funds and creative limitations that come with working with a team.

Additionally, fewer competitive races is beneficial for everyone , as it means less need for staff and fundraising.

Moana’s depiction of the demigod Maui as gigantic is considered among Polynesians as insensitive , considering that the obesity rate in the South Pacific is the highest in the world. And while many Disney movies are peppered with insensitive depictions of cultures, Arabs receive some of the worst treatment. The Phrygian opening song of Aladdin relates the “facts” of the Arab world that the audience is expected to accept: “ It’s barbaric, but hey, it’s home .” Aladdin’s hero is a thief, its law enforcement filled with easily duped zealots, their Sultan imbecilic, and its villain an evil sorcerer.

But surreal memes in particular are unable to sensitize or clarify, because they intentionally lack both sense and clarity. They traffic in absurdity for absurdity’s sake, which leaves them little hope to evolve into something meaningful or new. Surreal memes can only “progress” through the intensification of nonsense ad nauseum.

This leads many divorced parents to fall into poverty, as they must also cut back on work hours to provide after school care for their children.

This extends to all members of a unionized workplace, regardless of whether said members are in the union or not. For example, in 2018, low-cost airline Ryanair pilot unions succeeded in their struggle to improve pay and conditions across Europe.

There is a strong correlation between brand awareness and association and purchase decisions.

For example, you might not need three English-Finnish dictionaries, but if you decluttered room-by-room instead of by category, you may never realize you’d bought this item in triplicate. Adhering to Kondo’s category-based decluttering model also saves time previously spent looking for items around the home.

With the definition of terrorist groups highly dependent on the goals of each individual government, it’s easy to imagine how drone warfare could devolve into a free-for-all. Another example: the use and availability of drones are increasing casualties and intensities of regional clashes in areas like Armenia and Azerbaijan that, until now, have been limited by such countries’ inability to wage air campaigns. On a larger scale, a 2022 deadly drone attack in the middle of Abu Dhabi by Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels may mean an escalation of violence in an already volatile region. And let’s not forget about Syria, where the US and Russia are supporting opposing sides.

Gerrymandered districts allow for elected officials to choose their constituents , rather than giving voters the basic right to appoint their own representatives.

China’s financial system lacks credibility , as it is largely underdeveloped and subject to government meddling. Additionally, the financial sector rarely provides investors with real, profitable returns, and has been accused of limiting competition. For example, Uber failed in China after government preferences for state-owned enterprises gave Chinese rideshare company Didi a competitive edge. Although China has kept its pledge to open up its finance sector to foreign investment , including in VPN services , to counter said accusations, the level of government involvement in the economy overall puts China out of the running in the superpower race."}

Current and recent record-breaking heat waves and forest fires, as well as lack of rain in various countries around the world are likely products of human carelessness. Humanity’s oldest texts have stressed man’s responsibility to safeguard the world in which he lives. Genesis 1:26-27 tells us: “Let [man] rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth.” Here, man is assigned custodianship of the Earth and its creatures. If God’s great variety of species and ecosystems are to be preserved, it must be up to man to preserve them."}

There’s something intensely gratifying about finishing a story from start to finish; gorging on TV shows provides such an effect. Being completely immersed in a story’s plot line provides viewers with sheer escapism. Thanks to binge-watching, we don’t have to wait between various parts of a show’s narrative (and therefore we don’t forget it), which means we can handle and enjoy the intricacies of today’s shows, with their multiple plot lines and subtle twists."}

At city and county levels, such states are using their share to ramp up public initiatives , such as funding alcohol and drug treatments, school construction, veterans’ services and more.

He was under her care as a psychiatrist, and she transgressed the professional boundaries of their relationship. After joining his ranks, Harley had no problem committing crimes for fun, like kidnapping a billionaire because she was bored, robbing a store between fight scenes in Suicide Squad, and beating up Batman and trying to feed him to a tank of piranhas . While it’s pretty clear that Harley is abused by the Joker, it’s not enough to pardon her from her continuous abuse of others."}

Innocent victims who have been murdered – and in some cases, tortured beforehand – had no choice in their untimely and cruel death or any opportunity to say goodbye to friends and family, prepare wills, or enjoy their last moments of life. Meanwhile, convicted murderers sentenced to life in prison – and even those on death row – are still able to learn, read, write , paint, find religion, watch TV, listen to music, maintain relationships, and even appeal their sentences. To many, capital punishment symbolizes justice and is the only way to adequately express society’s revulsion of the murder of innocent lives. According to a 2021 Pew Research Center Poll, the majority of US adults ( 60% ) think that legal executions fit the crime of what convicted killers deserve. The death penalty is a way to restore society’s balance of justice – by showing that the most severe crimes are intolerable and will be punished in kind"}

Elon Musk, a purveyor of ingenuity and no stranger to forward-thinking, has often, in the past, spoken out against AI and its potential dangers for this reason. For example, he once said that while Google’s AI and robotics efforts are well-intentioned, the company could end up accidentally building a fleet of AI-driven robots “ capable of destroying mankind .” (That being said, he built and unveiled his own AI-powered Tesla robot in 2022). And let’s not forget about how a rogue Microsoft AI-powered chatbot told a NYT reporter that he and his wife didn’t love each other and then confided that it wanted to steal nuclear codes. Or the time when Facebook’s AI bots began communicating with one another in a language that humans couldn’t understand, puzzling their creators. Similar confusion ensued when Amazon’s Alexa devices began spontaneously laughing at their owners’ requests. AI complex algorithms may result in outcomes that surpass human understanding. If that happens, no one will be able to predict its next move."}

There are no laws in place to protect property owners, and the community members don’t have a say – or a warning – when drilling projects pop up around their houses. This introduces increased noise pollution, light pollution and traffic. As a result of these disruptions, property values in the vicinity of drilling sites often decrease dramatically. Even the former CEO of Exxon (one of the largest oil and gas corporations in America), Rex Tillerson, claimed that drilling would do “ irreparable harm ” to his property value, and he sued a water supply corporation to stop construction of a water tower that was being built to supply drilling operations in the vicinity."}

He is the best of his era on hard and grass courts. (He did lose 11 finals to Nadal on clay, which arguably shows that Federer is the second-best on clay when compared only to the Spaniard.) Versatility is what separates Federer from the rest. As mentioned, his one-handed backhand is a classic, and his forehand is one of the greatest shots in tennis , according to Pete Sampras. He controls every element in today’s tennis, such as the backhand smash and skyhook, half-volley and jump smash.

This is when a large enough portion of a community becomes immunized to disease, thereby limiting the chance of an outbreak within the entire community. Though it may not apply to Covid-19 , with other infectious diseases, such community protection can be important for infants, who are too young to be vaccinated. However, a critical number of people need to be vaccinated for this to work; for example, 42,000 people in the United States came down with whooping cough in 2012 after most of the country failed to meet the herd immunity criteria for pertussis vaccinations (92-94%), which was the highest outbreak in the previous 20 years. In other words, if your child isn’t vaccinated, he or she can pose a public health risk and increase the chances of disease outbreaks where you live."}

The news channel did not create these viewers, it just appeals to them. Fox is also not the powerhouse liberals imagine. While it has historically dominated cable news in the ratings contest (and still remains the most-watched cable news network among the key demographic despite the Dominion lawsuit controversy), that is a small market.

{"id": 899, "content": "Professional sports is a money-earning business. Sports teams know that to stay profitable they need to win, which is why they sign the best players available. Quality superstars, or “franchise players ,” are the face of the team. They make their teammates better, thereby improving the whole team (think Tom Brady Kevin Durant , and, of course, Michael Jordan , etc.). This leads to more wins and, in turn, more viewers, more merchandise sold and increased brand worth. Usually, a team has one franchise player, who makes a huge salary, arguably more than his projected value, since he drives the team’s business profitability forward. The amount of money that team owners are willing to pay franchise players often comes at the expense of the other players. However, with fans willing to pay more than 100% premiums on tickets to see individual players, like LeBron James, franchise players have extra responsibility to live up to their star power. They also have the celebrity effect, which draws more paying fans in. Therefore, they deserve to earn more."}

Imagine the panic that would have ensued if, for example, Americans had known how close they were to war during the Cuban Missile Crisis .

Slavery wasn’t Columbus’s only pastime – Spanish missionary Bartalome de Casas lamented that Columbus literally threw people to the dogs . Columbus’s brutality was so well known that the Spanish crown deposed him for floggings and extrajudicial executions of Spanish settlers.

Pain is not the only devastating consequence of terminal disease.

Let’s not overlook Cersei Lannister , one of the strongest (and meanest ) female characters on television. In Game of Thrones, women have as much (if not more) authority and power as men. They are warriors like Brienne of Tarth and Arya Stark, sorceresses like Melisandre, diplomats like Lady Olenna Tyrell, or women of great spirit like Osha .

Additionally, a National Survey of Children’s Health showed that children were physically healthier when living with two biological parents than in other familial arrangements. In other words, a monogamous relationship between parents seems to be healthiest for society’s children, suggesting that this relationship may naturally be the right one."}

The inflection of this voice is used to provoke an audience and tends to restrict topics addressed in Slam pieces to those that are largely political or sorrowful in nature. Slam voice is used with the intention of conveying anger or distress. Standard poetry, on the other hand, can be about anything it wants , and it can cover a range of emotions and experiences."}

With in-store shopping experiences becoming increasingly irrelevant, especially during the pandemic , competitive prices become online businesses’ key playing card. Large online retailers like Amazon know this and respond by offering the lowest market prices on their most popular and most viewed items. During recent holiday shopping seasons, sales were offered earlier in the year and for an extended period of time, which has seemingly become the norm . The internet’s price wars have an influence beyond cyberspace – many brick-and-mortar stores have adopted online price-matching policies in order to stay competitive with their online counterparts. Not to mention that swift “on-demand” order and delivery has changed consumer expectations (supply-chain problems aside), making convenience and comfort an ideal they can take for granted."}

An emerging theory from Germany posits that life on Earth may have started from a meteorite impact – one that had to have been incredibly precise to generate the molecules that now make up our world. Other theories, while differing in the “how,” agree that the merging of cells responsible for Earth’s intelligent beings is extremely rare – most likely a one-time event. Merely having the potential to support life may not be enough; Mars , for example, once had potential to harbor life – yet we still haven’t seen any evidence of this life."}

After the US announced its intention to pull out of the Agreement in 2017, President Joe Biden rejoined it in 2021, renewing America’s role in fighting climate change. As part of the agreement, 197 countries have promised to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, showing a sign of solidarity in trying to prevent and/or counter the potentially disastrous effects of climate change. Not to mention, the US recently signed into law the largest investment in climate action in US history. Can it be that nearly every other leader/country on the planet is wrong?"}

Three out of Kobe`s five rings were won together with Shaquille O’Neil , possibly the best center to ever play the game. Pau Gasol, Lamar Odom and Andrew Bynum, although none of them is a hall-of-famer, make a fantastic supportive team. Moreover, Kobe won his five rings with former coach Phil Jackson , who many argue is probably the sharpest basketball mind to ever exist. Meanwhile, LeBron won his first two rings as part of the Miami Heat`s trio. Aside from Dwayne Wade, LeBron’s supportive team lacked the quality that Kobe`s support had. LeBron won his championship third ring against a team that scored the best regular season record ever. LeBron won the finals’ MVP award and was the most dominant player in every championship he won. He might have fewer championship rings than Kobe had, but he played a bigger part in achieving them."}

In Syria, for example, Bashar al-Assad succeeded his father, Hafez, who ruled from 1971 to 2000, while Mubarak, Saleh and Gaddafi were believed to be grooming their sons as successors. The term jumlukiya , a combination of the Arabic words for republic and monarchy, had even been coined to describe the state of Arab rule. This concept was forcibly rejected by the Arab people. Not only have these rulers been tossed out, but the message has been sent of the power residing in the population. Whether something better replaces them remains to be seen."}

But this same Supreme Court decision also emphasizes that, in former Justice Antonin Scalia’s words: The Second Amendment is “not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for any purpose whatsoever.” Regulating deadly machinery (as we do with cars) is not about denying access but about oversight in the interest of safety for the community at large."}

It’s not only the government that’s swayed by Google’s authority; academic research teams haven’t necessarily been aware of who the patrons are that sponsor their grants.

But that could also be because their definitions have widened. (Pre-pandemic it was noted that more than 1 in 20 children and teens had anxiety or depression. Post-pandemic research suggests that rates of depression and anxiety in children worldwide have doubled .) Spectrum diseases like the aforementioned are sometimes difficult to spot, but awareness of the symptoms of spectrum diseases like ADHD and others have enabled millions across the globe – including three-quarters of newly diagnosed adults, who became aware of their symptoms because of fallout from the pandemic – to treat their disorders, a fine achievement for the field of mental health."}

There are many investment options within the account – such as trading options or mutual funds – but you can also just put plain old money away for the future. Where real estate investments incur taxes, the assets you funnel into specific IRAs (like Roth IRAs ) can grow tax-free, and your money can be withdrawn without income tax penalties. There are several kinds of IRAs available that differ based on your income level, but there is usually a suitable option for everyone.

Home equity loans and lines of credit can help to turn a fixed asset into a liquid one.

Home equity can also help homeowners to finance anticipated expenses like college tuition and vacations at significantly lower interest rates than those offered on student or personal loans. (Plus, the payments are tax deductible – woohoo!). And, homeownership can provide monthly dividends for those who decide to turn their homes into rentals . Even if you downsize to a smaller rental of your own, you’ll pocket the difference each month, which can help turn into savings or even an extra vacation."}

The recent George Floyd protests have put the spotlight on discussions regarding systemic racism in America toward Black people. The BLM’s huge desire to save their own families from abuse, inequality and murder (especially of unarmed victims, like Trayvon Martin , Breonna Taylor , or Ahmaud Arbery – not to mention George Floyd ) lends power to their cause, which we cannot expect them to feel for any other cause. The BLM’s focus on Black Lives does not undermine the worthiness of any other minority’s fight against racism or of any other social justice issue; it merely indicates that this is the issue that they are standing up for right now."}

Luckily, open floor plans tend to encourage employees to spend more time standing up and moving around. Employees can stretch their bodies and their minds, removing much physical and cognitive tension from the workday. Five minutes of motion every hour during the workday can lift employees’ moods, fight exhaustion without reducing attention, and even mitigate the effects of hunger pangs, a study reveals. Employees working out of open spaces are therefore likely to form more positive work associations, and experience less real and perceived pain as a result of the workday."}

However, in 2022, they officially exited bankruptcy following the largest public debt restructuring in US history. Since Puerto Rico is not currently a U.S. state, it was unable to access Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code , when it fell on financial hardship. What’s more, even if Puerto Rico could access these rights, at that time, he island’s $49 billion of unfunded pension liabilities and $74 billion debt, held by the territory’s government as well as by local public corporations, was so great that they could only cover one-third of the accrued debt. If granted statehood, the U.S. would have inherited this debt. The question is, can the U.S. cope with the challenges that making Puerto Rico a state would impose, or would America (and its national treasury) drown in the process? The aftermath of Hurricane Maria brings up another serious aspect to consider. If Puerto Rico becomes a U.S. state, it would require a lot of money and resources from FEMA every time a natural disaster occurs. Due to hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Florence, FEMA is already stretched too thin, and several communities within the U.S. are still awaiting assistance. Adding Puerto Rico to the mix would cause much-needed federal funding to be directed away from other U.S. states, at a time where natural disasters are on the rise in America."}

For example, the only element that separates rap from spoken word is the addition of background music to rap, which is sometimes even present in Slam as well. Also, the performance aspects that are necessary for Slam pieces to make an impact are more similar to acting and practically non-existent within poetry. People attend poetry slams like they would a show at the theater, and the audience who shows up doesn’t need to have any understanding of poetry to enjoy themselves. With this in mind, Slam doesn’t seem to add anything substantial specifically to the world of poetry."}

But rarely does military action improve the lives of ordinary citizens. The US mission in Libya was aimed at stopping a government-led massacre of its citizens. It may have done that, but Gaddafi’s death in 2011 led to civil war and chaos in the country, with ISIS gaining a foothold. Post-occupation Iraq looks no better, and Afghanistan remains at the mercy of the Taliban , more than 20 years after the 2001 US invasion.

Exchanging money for sexual interaction, an interaction that is commonly regarded as both an expression and vehicle of intimacy reduces this bond-solidifying act to a mere transaction.

Speculation is another tool for transferring wealth from the rich to the poor, which drove the 2007 mortgage crisis. The actual value of the homes that were speculated upon was much lower than the speculation-driven market value. When the speculators at the top realized this, they cashed out, precipitating the housing crash and resulting in more than two million home foreclosures .

Pain management is not only about easing pain but providing emotional comfort. The presence of encouraging family members, a skilled midwife or a doula can deliver emotional support that is proven to mitigate discomfort during labor. Breathing exercises, massage, and warm water are also all tried and true methods used to manage birthing pains today, and are even utilized in hospitals. Pain relief doesn’t need to be high-tech or all-encompassing to effectively aid mothers through labor and delivery.

Most strikes, for example, negatively affect everybody – not just the people unions are trying to negotiate with. Teachers’ strikes, even over coronavirus safety concerns during the pandemic, still hurt children who were trying to learn and parents who needed to find last-minute arrangements for their kids; similarly, a health workers’ strike could potentially endanger the lives of the sick. It seems that this hurting of the general public is a tool that unions will use to get what they want. Moreover, union violence has been used in the past, such as in the Occupy Oakland strike of 2011, which culminated in violent riots that were later condoned by the US Supreme Court. Good intentions or not, public harm should not be an acceptable means for unions to achieve their goals."}

For instance, Ryanair bought 151 new planes of the same model (Boeing 737) during the post-9/11 air travel slump; the large size of the order is what made each plane so cheap. Many of the air carriers that budget airlines use are newly built or recently retrofitted to meet current safety standards and requirements, and passengers are able to enjoy a smoother, safer flight. Some argue that the planes may also be more fuel-efficient . In fact, the fuel efficiency of younger planes offsets the more expensive purchase price of newer models. That’s how EasyJet has four-year-old planes and Spirit’s vessels average 5.7 years. This, unfortunately, is not the case of many traditional airlines, which continue to fly planes that can be 20 or more years old!"}

In 2020, the Pentagon established a UAP taskforce , which has since been replaced by another government office to continue its research into identifying unidentified objects. Such UFO sightings, which have recently extended over Canada , have ranged from bizarre lights over the New Jersey Turnpike to aircrafts moving faster than sound and hovering around the coast of San Diego.

In addition, although unions are meant to control and prevent worker exploitation, sometimes the reverse ends up happening, where leaders exploit their own members. Unite Here , the former hotel and restaurant workers’ union, reportedly pressured union members to publicly divulge personal information about themselves (bordering on psychological abuse), because they believed it would attract newcomers to the union. Additionally, Philadelphia unions were filmed using intimidation, threats and violence on numerous occasions to get their way.

Most importantly, players want fighting eliminated; this was relayed by the Florida Panthers’ veteran defenseman, Willie Mitchell, who said the league needed to do a “better job” defending players.

The “value-neutral state,” i.e., a country that does not take a stand, as described by Jeremy Waldron in his influential book , is detrimental.

Although Jackson settled the 1993 accusations of sexual abuse out of court and was later acquitted of other accusations laid against him in 2003 , Michael’s bizarre and questionable behavior, namely, his unusual relationships with children, underpinned the public’s suspicions. In fact, a 2005 trial in a Gallup poll reported that most Americans believed that the charges leveled against Jackson were true.

This was intended to close the gap between minority and poverty-stricken students with those from higher-income families. Not only do standardized tests give every student the opportunity to learn the same material as their peers in other schools, but state funding laws incentivize schools to ensure every student does well on these exams. As Washington State’s Senator Patty Murray once said about education laws, “We know that if we don’t have ways to measure students’ progress, and if we don’t hold states accountable, the victims will invariably be the kids from poor neighborhoods, children of color, and students with disabilities.”"}

A Princeton study found that public opinion hardly comes to bear on legislation, and the results of most protests confirms this. The anti-war movement against US military involvement in Vietnam that was popularized on college campuses in 1965 had no effect on war activities, which were in fact ramped up until the war’s end in 1973.

The results were swift and vicious; countless people demanded that the misidentified victim lose his job, accused him of racism and posted his address on social media. This is just one of many examples where misinformation can do serious damage to innocent people. Similarly, in the wake of the 2013 Boston Marathon tragedy, Reddit’s now infamous FindBostonBombers subreddit thread took to scanning pictures of the marathon, and it quickly became open season on young males with dark hair and backpacks. Using unconfirmed information from police scanners , the Reddit community irreparably tarnished the reputations of several innocent people, two of which were harassed online and in person. Unfortunately for the erroneously accused, the e-sleuths who slandered them faced no consequences, as Reddit maintains user anonymity."}

Just like every new technology poses new concerns (hello, AI ), each advance or step forward in norms of social acceptability have always had nay-sayers and detractors who worry about censorship or limits to free speech. Before women got the vote , anti-suffragists argued that women didn’t even want to vote and that it would simply make the election process more costly and unwieldy. Before the GOP was formed to promote abolition, people worried that the end of slavery would devastate the cotton and tobacco trades. New norms can take time to establish but, looking back, it’s hard to imagine any other way."}

He came up with the Triangle Offense, which Chuck Klosermann called “the single most dominant offensive attack of the past 20 years.” It entails a team forming a triangle with the post, wing and corner players. Being disciplined about staying in formation, switching positions and smart passing make it incredibly hard to defend against. The Triangle Offense became legendary because of its effectiveness and how hard it was to pull off. Others tried to imitate it, but none could coach it like Jackson did."}

The plans eventually lead to increased output and great economic development."}

For example, Grand Slam Poetry Champion Harry Baker performs a powerful and amusing piece about prime numbers , while sticking to all the elements of spoken word. Yet, there are many written poems expressing a fascination for prime numbers as well; both modes of expression are able to convey similar ideas, albeit by using different tools. The human voice captures emotion as well as the written word; rather than assessing the nature of Slam as “other” than poetry, it makes more sense when viewed as an enhancement of what written poetry already does, i.e., each are art forms that provide a way to effectively communicate emotions."}
{"id": 973, "content": "While scientists today don’t have a consensus on what causes obesity, many think it is often caused by a number of underlying genetic or metabolic factors that cause people to gain weight or make them unable to lose weight. Genes control everything from a person’s ability to metabolize food to how full one feels after a meal. In some individuals, genetic factors can influence obesity by as much as 80%. Those who have a greater genetic disposition toward obesity are not usually able to lose weight or maintain weight loss through diet and exercise alone. Studies have shown that for long-term success, chronically obese patients indeed require intervention beyond incorporating a healthy diet and exercise into one’s lifestyle. Bariatric and other forms of gastric surgeries show the most salient results for long-term weight management."}

Heart stents only require a very small incision into the skin, and the procedure calls for a local anesthetic. While heart stents run the risk of side effects, the risks are not nearly as large as those in bypass surgery, and you can usually resume daily activities within the week. In contrast, bypass surgery is very invasive, with patients rarely feeling back to normal for weeks to months afterwards. Side effects with bypass surgery can include anything from weakness and pain to risk of stroke, which occurs to 1.6-2.6% of people post-surgery."}

More recently, Switzerland’s HSBC has been implicated in colluding with the world’s most ignominious criminals – from Haitian dictator Jean Claude Duvalier to Osama Bin Laden. The Panama Papers revealed that HSBC was one of many financial institutions that gave shelter to illicit activity and supported tax evasion. If that isn’t enough, Latvia’s ABLV bank was accused of money laundering not long ago, and has allowed their clients to do business with countries like North Korea, which violates sanctions imposed by the U.N.

This investigation suggested key differences in liberal and conservative mindsets – with one leaning toward the discovery of new experiences and the other emphasizing self-discipline and order.

Another song, which feels like an addition to the show, is about the future that happens in Doc’s mind.

Work experience gives you a leg up on future employability and helps you to shape your own career goals. While you may not know exactly which field you’d like to pursue, the soft skills you’ll gain in any job will be crucial to moving you forward in life.

Aside from having the freedom to choose your own hours and allocate your energy however you want, you can do something that’s both satisfying and lucrative. While starting your own business may be risky, it gives you the potential to grow revenue that far surpasses a monthly rent check.

This may be an absurd level of precision for daily life, but it is increasingly important as we push the limits of human athletic performance. We can also measure time by counting the number of times the Earth goes around the Sun , just as humans have done for thousands of years. If counted, this shows linear progress from a starting point onward. Or we can measure the vibration of cesium-133 atoms, as is done to set International Atomic Time . That global standard is so accurate that it will take 1.4 million years for it to be off by a full second. These natural phenomena can be recorded in long, cumulative and linear sequences."}

Likewise, product manufacturers provide free demos, and entrepreneurs understand that they need to spend money to prove that their concept works if they want to break into the market. Unpaid internships are no different than any of these examples. When young people work in unpaid internships, they are essentially building their CVs. By attaching their names to a reputable firm, that firm’s reputation stands out on the interns’ CVs. They are given the opportunity to demonstrate their dedication, work ethic and willingness to learn – not to mention acquire a wide range of skills and contacts – which are all vital for getting a good-paying job in the future. In fact, college students who had internships are 15% less likely to be unemployed in the years after graduating college than those who didn’t."}

Protests can win exposure for a cause, but they do not fight legal battles that make change possible. Look at Roe. V. Wade.

The composition of Hollywood’s executive offices and professional guilds is even less promising. Ninety-four percent of major production studio executives are white, and until 2017, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ membership was 91% white .

{"id": 986, "content": "When Greenspan left the Fed in 2006, two Princeton economists noted that he “has a legitimate claim to being the greatest central banker that has ever lived.” The financial crisis understandably led to a re-evaluation of this legacy, but what Greenspan accomplished during his term should not be overlooked. Greenspan saw two recessions during nearly two decades. These bookended the longest expansion in US history, as the country saw 10 years of GDP growth. From 1992 to 1999, the economy grew an average of 4 percent per year , a rate unseen in the post-Greenspan era. Greenspan was also a steady hand through two Gulf Wars and 9/11. The financial crisis must be factored into any evaluation of Alan Greenspan’s accomplishments but should not overshadow all else."}

In a 2021 Gallup poll , 43% of Americans described themselves as Republicans compared to 46% as Democrats. Additional reports suggest that liberal bias has given way to another problem: journalists overall are too cautious to avoid being labeled as too liberal or too conservative. This helps explain why half of Americans in a recent survey indicated that they believe news organizations deliberately mislead them. Critics of Fox News tend to assume that the network is responsible for this distrust, yet even amid recent court filings that have verified instances of false reporting, its ratings have held steady among its base. Additionally, recent years have seen the rise of numerous far-right networks, from Breitbart News to the conspiracy theory-filled Infowars . For all its faults, Fox News is much closer to the mainstream than these sources. Without Fox News, sites like Infowars would benefit more than CNN."}
{"id": 988, "content": "A huge advantage that innovators have when coming out with their product is being the sole seller of the product. The time period until their ideas are copied and products are reproduced is key in building a lasting relationship with their customers. By being the only option on the market, consumers have no other options and must turn to the innovator himself or herself when purchasing. Research shows that the most critical time to gain consumer loyalty is when they make their first purchase or begin service. As it costs about 6-7 times more to acquire new customers than it does to keep current ones, it’s better to “strike while the iron is hot” and make sure you get those first customers on board."}
{"id": 989, "content": "While being overweight or obese can have a number of negative effects on overall health and quality of life, it is hardly a focus of medicine. Medical schools tend to focus on pathology, devoting little time to matters of nutrition and activity’s impact on health. This leaves physicians ill-equipped to advise their patients on such matters. As such, terming obesity a disease stands to restructure physicians’ values and learning on the topic. Designating obesity as a disease rather than a consequence of poor lifestyle may relieve the stigma surrounding it and encourage those affected to seek medical assistance, instead of avoiding appointments for fear of humiliation. It may provide doctors the opportunity to address such matters diplomatically and accurately, like by prescribing the diabetes drug Ozempic to induce weight loss, instead of equating obesity with lifestyle behavior, thereby leaving patients feeling fat-shamed , which has been found to promote weight gain , or wanting to avoid the issue altogether."}

Additionally, dictators like Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin and Saddam Hussein, to name just a few, rose to power by exploiting people’s fears. When gripped by fear, whether real or imagined, it can slow or disrupt people’s rationale and abilities to make cognitive decisions.

What’s the difference between the Hebrew, Chinese, Gregorian, and Mayan calendars? Ultimately, and from the perspective of time itself, not much. These calendars have different origins, starting points, counting systems, and holidays that are relevant only to people, not animals, plants, or the planet.

Whether blatantly or subtly conditioned by family or societal pressures and norms, these fears often linger in our unconscious, influencing our career and relationship choices. For example, people may embark on a particular education and career path solely out of fear of disappointing or being rejected by their parents. Yet even if pursuing your genuine passion and dream job, fear of failure can limit your career potential – as can fear of success. The latter, clinically deemed Imposter Syndrome , is the crippling yet common phenomenon of doubting one’s abilities and decisions. On a personal level, being afraid of going against social convention can make people forsake true love for marriages that bring material stability. On the flip side, this same fear can also keep people trapped in doomed marriage s instead of divorcing ."}

In addition to enjoying longer lives, mothers in particular seem to receive a competitive edge with regard to workplace productivity when they have children. One writer for Quartz calls motherhood “the ultimate efficiency hack” and explains that a 30-year review of productivity of female economists (mothers and non-mothers alike) revealed that mothers outperformed their childless counterparts.

But, if a pregnant woman knows there is no way for her to give her child-to-be the physical, emotional and financial sustenance he or she needs to survive and thrive, or if the fetus is diagnosed with a life-limiting medical condition , many believe that it is the mother’s right and obligation to make a very adult decision. This includes taking responsibility and preventing the unborn child from having a life of pain, suffering, sadness and neglect. It is far easier to continue with a pregnancy than it is to supply a living child with everything he or she requires.

Perhaps more damaging is the reflexive partisanship, which in recent years manifested itself in a constant criticism of Obama and seemingly uncritical defense of former President Trump. Plus, the former president’s hiring in the summer of 2018 of former Fox executive Bill Shine to head White House communications strengthened the perception that the network and Republican party were closely linked.

In The Little Mermaid, King Triton’s use of his magic triton is portrayed as benevolent and good. Yet, in the hands of a woman (Ursula), it is unequivocally evil and wreaks havoc in the order of the natural world, as expressed through the storm she conjures.

Data from a Stanford study that monitored call center employees who worked work from home revealed that this impression has merit: Employees who worked from home answered 13.5% more phone calls than their office-bound counterparts. Homes are largely devoid of typical workplace distractions, engendering deeper concentration for workers and increases in overall productivity for those who employ them. In fact, a recent State of Work Productivity Report found that 65% of full-time employees surveyed thought a remote work schedule would increase productivity."}
{"id": 1015, "content": "Labeling Israel as an apartheid state oversimplifies the complexities of the multi-layered Israeli-Palestinian conflict. First, Palestinians fall under three vastly different groups based on geography: people who live in Gaza, people who live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and Arab Israelis who live in Israel. There is no such as thing as one Palestinian entity that Israel addresses in one specific way. Second, what outsiders might see as Israeli hostility toward Palestinians can be seen as a reaction to life-threating violence . The history of conflict and terrorism – which isn’t relegated to history but, sadly, a part of the country’s present – has led to necessary defensive security measures, such as border checkpoints and controls, aimed at protecting Israeli citizens from repeated terrorist attacks. Israelis strongly feel that if they don’t manage the Palestinian situation, they and their family members can be raped and murdered . It’s as simple as that. Even Palestinians who had legal work permits to cross into Israel from Gaza and had been welcomed as friends into the kibbutzim where they worked were later found to be guilty of leading and/or aiding Hamas terrorists in their murderous massacre on Oct. 7, 2023."}
{"id": 1016, "content": "Major airlines are better equipped with resources to help passengers when needs arise, in comparison to their low-cost counterparts. In the event of flight delays, cancellations or luggage misplacement, traditional airlines have policies in place to offer passengers travel rerouting, refunds and compensation packages. This is something that low-cost airlines are not always able to do, as was seen with the 2018 Ryanair airline strike , during which hundreds of flights were cancelled. Another example is the case of Icelandic low-cost airline Wow Airlines, which left thousands of passengers stranded at Kaflavik airport in March 2019 when it declared bankruptcy and suddenly ceased operations . While traditional airlines are not perfect , they try to stick to relatively strict flight schedules and allow passengers to view their plane seats ahead of time. Low-cost airlines, on the other hand, reserve the right to make last-minute flight timing and seating changes, without due warning."}

This may be because of potentially harmful ingredients in ayahuasca that our bodies want to prevent from reaching our brains. In general, hallucinogens can cause unpleasant, short-term side effects , like increased heart rate, loss of appetite, sleep disruptions and blood pressure. As a result, our bodies try to refuse ayahuasca by throwing it up . Regardless of how much ayahuasca may open your mind, the body’s obvious rejection of the drug should be a sign that it’s unhealthy and should be avoided."}

The church refers to fees for these services as donations , and while they call the spiritual freedom that accompanies Scientology “priceless,” they are careful not to specify how much one might donate to achieve a heightened state of spiritual awareness. One Carnegie Mellon University professor estimated the cost of Scientology coursework alone at $300,000 ; ex-church members including Leah Remini and Paul Haggis have given even bigger estimates. For a small religion (its membership is thought to be less than 50,000 worldwide), that is ostensibly a non-profit organization focused on spiritual work, the Church of Scientology has amassed staggering amount of wealth ."}

Through the (now defunct) White House Council on Women and Girls and increased enforceability of laws designed to combat pay discrimination, Obama’s administration directed efforts to ensure that American women could achieve financial independence. Higher minimum wages meant mothers could spend more time with their children; paid family leave would allow parents to parent without curbing their careers and ultimately, their spending power. Linking gender equality to America’s economic prosperity helped Obama to co-opt bipartisan support for a number of women’s issues.

Kids, especially socially awkward ones, sometimes lack the social skills required to make or interact with friends. They may shy away from social interactions if they feel out of place. But face-to-face interaction is a critical life skill . When we interact with others, we are continuously processing wordless signals like facial expressions, tone of voice, and even the physical distance between us. Equipping children with smartphones may increase the chance that they will choose the phone over learning to socialize with other kids. This will make it harder for them in the long term to face social situations as they grow up. Sure, the pandemic and its lockdowns altered what parents considered a normal amount of smartphone and screen time for kids. But the consequences of too much screen time – which school is supposed to be an escape from – can include increased obesity, irregular sleep, impaired academic performance, desensitization to violence, etc."}

One study found that certain conditions (and not personality types) predispose people to trolling: if a thread of comments begins with a trolling comment, if a person is in a bad mood, or if it is simply the start of the work-week, people are more likely to troll.

In MMA, kicks to most body parts, including the head, are allowed. When they connect well, they can be incredibly devastating as can be seen here . This kind of impact can cause immense trauma to the head and brain, resulting in some serious damage. Kicks are part of sports like Taek Wondo or Jiu Jitsu, but they are less dangerous in those sports due to fighters wearing head protection or kicking less frequently. The ability to kick also resulted in some MMA fighters aiming for their opponents’ knees , often with the intent to bend them in and break them, known as the “ oblique kick .” There needs to be a line between healthy athletic competition and causing terrible long-term injuries."}

Research shows that 60% of high schoolers have had sex by the time they graduate. Therefore, introducing the idea of condom use into their conscience at such a formative age may help teens view contraception as second nature as opposed to something that either gender will have to continually negotiate with future partners. Also worth noting, with the Supreme Court’s overturn of Roe V. Wade, access to abortion is getting more limited across the US, which only emphasizes the need for more access to condoms."}

{"id": 1031, "content": "Low-cost airlines take a no-frills approach, which is how they are able to keep their fees relatively lower than traditional airlines. They save on luxuries, like reclining seats, which reduces initial plane purchase and maintenance costs. This translates into less expensive tickets. Plus, flight attendants on low-cost airlines often cover many roles, including ticketing, in-flight services and cleaning. Having a smaller staff also means companies can reduce their ticket prices. While the in-flight experience may not be as comfortable (to a degree) as with traditional airlines, travel is a means to an end. Who wouldn’t prefer spending their hard-earned money on the reason(s) they are flying – be it hotel, shopping, or exotic destination – than on the flight itself? Plus, if taking one of the many red-eye flights that low-cost airlines offer, you’ll also have fewer crowds to deal with at the airport, which leaves more time for sightseeing."}

Various studies comparing crime and murder rates in U.S. states that have the death penalty versus those that don’t found that the murder rate in non-death-penalty states has actually remained consistently lower over the years than in those states that have the death penalty. These findings suggest that capital punishment may not actually be a deterrent for crime. The winds may be shifting regarding the public’s opinion about the death penalty. This is evident by the recent decision of a non-unanimous Florida jury to sentence the Parkland High School shooter to life in prison without parole instead of the death penalty . While the verdict shocked many, it also revealed mixed feelings about the death penalty, including among the families of the 17 Parkland victims and families of victims from other mass shootings."}

Success is generally measured by a song or clip having “ gone viral ,” and accessibility to said media – i.e. through illegal downloading sites – is a key component of making that happen. A few years ago, the EU withheld a study that found that piracy had less of an impact on sales than originally thought. It found that copyright infringement of music, books, and video games in Europe didn’t necessarily detract from sales; in this vein, musicians at least generally don’t expect their tracks to be bought. After building their brand, musicians’ incomes are instead rooted in merchandise and live performances. Additionally, revenue from the music streaming industry is sharply increasing each year, underscoring the fact that a new economy, defined by new norms, has emerged, and it’s here to stay."}

In seven out of those 12 Grand Slams, Federer beat Andy Roddick (who admits he is one of the worst players to ever hold the no.1 ranking), Lleyton Hewitt, Mark Philippoussis, Marat Safin and Marcos Baghdatis, none of who are considered elite players, and who weren’t ranked highly when Federer won against them. The average ranking of the players Federer faced in the finals during those years is 16.3. Back then, Djokovic’s average, for example, stood at 6.5, meaning Federer played against weaker players than Djokovic did in the finals at that time. Federer’s decline in wins coincides with the emergence of Nadal and Djokovic . His impressive record of Grand Slam wins should be attributed mostly to his lack of competition during those earlier years.

Additionally, some volunteers who helped restore homes in Haiti after a 2010 earthquake found that after they left, their projects exacerbated social divisions among the community members because they needed more help with poverty than with rebuilding houses. Similarly, people in Ghana are less likely to buy health insurance because foreign volunteers often bring medications with them, leaving the communities more susceptible to disease while they wait for aid.

However, the demand to see Wenger leave was based on emotions rather than on realistic thinking . Arsenal’s rivals, like Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City, are far richer, and their regularly finishing in the top spots of British soccer is extraordinary. Arsenal fans got used to Wenger leading his team into the top league rankings in the past, so, once the team started losing, they found it hard to acknowledge the fantastic work done by the Frenchman.

While the 2022 men’s national team that played in Qatar reportedly only had 3 Latino players , it’s hard to ignore this small but potentially growing influence that immigrants have on US soccer. Immigrants specifically from Mexico or Brazil tend to bring along their love for the sport, spreading it to their kids.

But this decline has much more to do with modernization than with globalization. Increasing productivity, driven in large part by technological advances , has allowed companies to do more with fewer workers. While the first decade of the 21st century saw manufacturing jobs falling, manufacturing output actually grew by $800 billion over the same period . Simply put, if new technology allows one person to do the job previously done by five, it will benefit the consumer and the firm, but cost jobs in that sector. While, according to some estimates, NAFTA led to a net loss of around 100,000 jobs through 2010, this number should be looked at on a macro level. Yes, this was significant for those workers and their families, but at just 0.1 percent of the US labor force, this figure is far from economically crippling."}

Over the years, Messi has continually managed to outscore Ronaldo in the last minutes of the game, otherwise known as injury-time goals . Moreover, Messi makes better decisions. Using a complex algorithm, a company called GoodCall values a player’s decision-making and Efficiency Per Match (EPM).

Every team is given the freedom to innovate to beat the competition. For example, in 2011, Red Bull created a car with an exhaust-blown diffuser that gave it a significant advantage. Other teams quickly reacted by copying the design. Formula 1’s governing body then banned this tech, but that just resulted in engineers creating workarounds to still gain the priceless advantage."}

Had A-Rod stayed at the position, there would be no conversation about who was the greatest shortstop in baseball history. But in 2004, Rodriguez was traded to the New York Yankees and moved over to third base to allow Jeter to stay at his position. Even so, A-Rod played more career games at short than he did at the hot corner. When stacking Jeter up against the all-time greats, Rodriguez must be in the conversation, and with 696 career home runs and three MVP awards, he is on a different level than his longtime teammate."}

Interestingly, one study found that having faced adversity – namely violence, loss of a loved one, or experiencing illness or disability – is indeed a predictor of extreme political views ; the more adversity people faced, the more likely they were to lean to the far-right or far-left in their ideologies. Experiencing adversity may explain the rhetoric of victimization that permeates the far-left as well as the far-right.

Before the coronavirus pandemic hit, it could be argued that without families to support or even necessarily the need to support themselves, the average college student has more free time than others to develop defined political views. As such, it is hardly surprising that constituents on the far-right and far-left are overwhelmingly educated and even well-off (a trend that held even for the Hezbollah fighters of the 1980s and 90s).

BLM activists only know what it is like to live as Black people in America, especially regarding issues of police brutality ; therefore, they should not take it upon themselves to speak for Latin-Americans, Asian-Americans or Hispanic Americans. Moreover, saying that all lives matter can be seen as downplaying the racism specifically targeted at Black Americans or shifting attention away from them to other groups.

Beyond contamination, formula makers do not always ensure consumer safety. One extreme case of the failure of powdered formula to properly nourish infants comes from Israel, where, in 2003, vitamin B-1 deficient Remedia formula led to 3 infant deaths and severe damage to 23 other infants.

They demonstrate and validate the virtues of defense, which are often overlooked. This brings many sports figures (from players to commentators) to glorify defense and to believe that it wins NFL championships. While great defense has won championships for certain NFL teams, it doesn’t mean that defense always leads to championship victories. The main difference is that because the importance of offense in football is obvious, it isn’t as glorified as defense. But this doesn’t mean that offense doesn’t win championships or that defense more often wins championships."}

Unlike finite resources like fossil fuels and shale rock, which eventually run out and negatively impact the environment, renewable energy sources regenerate and can be used continuously. For example, solar energy takes sunlight and allows it to be used for electricity, hot water, heat, etc. A study published in the journal Science of the Total Environment ranked fracking between 4th-8th place in sustainability when compared to other energy resources. In comparison, renewable energy significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and is the cleaner pathway to energy consumption."}

But throughout his election, much came to light about Trump and his policies that many perceived as outrageous and threatening to liberal ideals. For example, Trump was caught on tape making lewd remarks about women that many viewed as being akin to sexual assault. As a result, from the moment Trump was elected there have been numerous Women’s Marches, which have become one of the biggest protest movements in American history. Trump has since dug himself deeper in the eyes of liberals, what with his aggressive immigration stance and his use of an expletive to refer to other countries (including the entire continent of Africa). Through all of his blunders, Trump has given liberals a common antagonist, and more liberals than ever have become politically involved to fight back. Let’s not forget that lower voter turnout contributed to Trump’s victory, a fact that now inspires liberals young and old to be more involved in the political system or face repercussions."}

While many of these industries have made do – or even blossomed – because of the pandemic, many online streaming platforms and newspapers were financially insolvent before the pandemic. The abundance of free information and free content stymies news outlets and broadcasters from being able to request payment at all. Dwindling newsroom staff means less investigative journalism.

For the regulated surrogate – a base compensation of around $25,000 can be expected, though it can be more and the absolving of her responsibility towards the child and its intended parents following childbirth. From an equality perspective, surrogate mothers are well informed and conscious of their choice. The act of surrogacy can therefore be viewed as an educated and informed economic opportunity."}

Furthermore, a competitive atmosphere can also drive students to achieve (or at least try to achieve) better results, academically as well as in extracurricular activities. Excellent academic achievements at an early school age may lead to continued excellence in higher education, setting the stage for increased confidence and success later in life. For instance, a recent study showed that high school grade point averages can predict college graduation rates 5 times more than SAT scores – and that each incremental increase in GPA improved the odds of a student’s college graduation. Whether by test scores or GPA, a conventional schooling’s structured focus on academic success is a long-term motivating factor for students."}

But consider the welfare costs of not taking maternity leave. Many parents can’t afford to live on one income, even for just a few weeks. They slip into credit card debt and might be forced to turn to food stamps and other welfare payments. A report from the United States Department of Labor discovered that approximately 15% of people who took unpaid or partly-paid leave turned to welfare payments.

Politically, Putin’s tactics to mitigate the opposition’s chances in municipal elections in Moscow in 2019 prompted allegations of him corrupting democracy . This corruption is seemingly nothing new for the leader. As a way to retain a tight grip on power, in 2021, Putin signed into law a controversial bill that allows for constitutional changes that may help him remain in power until 2036.

{"id": 1083, "content": "In football, good strong defense provides a good field position, which allows the offense to start their drive-to-goal in a better position, thus allowing an easier time scoring. Additionally, good defense forces turnovers on the opponents, and turnovers’ impact on football scores cannot be overestimated. A positive turnover differential significantly increases the probability of winning. Moreover, in today’s professional football, interceptions are much more likely to be returned for touchdowns, as was seen in 2022 , when an interception by the Cincinnati Bengals’ led to their game-tying touchdown and eventual 2022 AFC championship win over Kansas City. Thus, defense is the best offense."}

In separate instances, many organizations based in Poland and Greece have welcomed volunteers to help distribute necessary supplies, medical aid, and food to Ukrainian and Syrian refugees and to help resettle them. Additionally, after the two earthquakes hit Nepal and killed thousands of people in 2015, 3,000 volunteers have helped restore schools, homes, playgrounds, renewable energy, sanitation and more – and there is still more work to be done.

By doing so, Snowden not only undermined U.S. alliances around the world but also U.S. efforts to undermine enemies that operate in countries where citizens have less ability to protect themselves from tyranny.

In 2016, coal workers of the China’s Longmay coal firm prompted the government to admit financial struggles and demand back payment of thousands of workers. Additionally, the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement was similarly effective in giving America’s lower income bracket a voice, shedding light on the growing chasm between the top 1% of American earners and the rest of the nation. More recently, the nationwide protests across America in response to the murder of George Floyd at the hands of a police officer have brought police brutality and racism into the spotlight, forcing Americans to address the ongoing disparate treatment of African Americans , especially by law enforcement, which has been unchecked for decades.

David sends one of his soldiers to certain death purely because he was interested in the soldier’s wife . Judas trades the son of God for thirty coins. Let’s compare these to women’s transgressions. Rachel steals idols from her father’s house, Moses’s sister Miriam is punished for gossiping about him, and some women have illicit affairs. At their worst, the sins of biblical females are almost heartwarmingly mild.

In a school setting, this can and should be extended to exhibiting individuality through clothing. Forcing all students to wear the same thing infringes on this right. It can also stifle students’ self-expression, which is a strong need during adolescence.

This rendered the dollar the most important currency in the world, and as a result, the US became the world’s foundation for economic stability.

Unlike other sitcoms before and since, Seinfeld ’s secondary characters weren’t necessarily just about advancing the story but also about providing laughs, which is equally important. The show was also the first of its kind to go against the grain of typical feel-good sitcoms to nurture the rise of the antihero . Seinfeld pioneered the idea that main characters don’t have to be good or likable. They can be superficial, peculiar, painfully honest or downright immoral and still make audiences laugh and root for them (like being relieved when your fiancé dies .)

(For example, monkeys, Ebola’s first victims, could benefit from a developmental Ebola vaccination). The reflexive nature of advances and human sciences is expressed in the One Health initiative , whose central premise connects human health to the health of animals as well as the environment.

Boston Globe columnist Renée Graham points out that even when a black star does score a lead role, it is most often against the backdrop of a white character who facilitates the black character’s – a “ white savior ,” she calls them. For example, the film Hidden Figures , depicts a black NASA mathematician whose success is sponsored by her benevolent white boss. Similar dynamics occur in the movies The Blind Side , The Help, and 2018’s controversial Oscar winner , Green Book , among others. This begs the question of why Hollywood can’t seem to let its black heroes stand alone."}
{"id": 1105, "content": "Game of Thrones can’t make up its mind about what kind of show it wants to be. It is simultaneously fantasy, zombie thriller, medieval political drama, and dungeons and dragons choose-your-own-adventure. The characters are drawn from too wide array of genres; Ser Barristan is reminiscent of a knight of the roundtable while Bran Stark is Westeros’s answer to X-Men’s Charles Xavier. In its ambition to incorporate a broad catalogue of supernatural elements, Game of Thrones ends up with a mish-mosh of other-worldly ingredients that simply don’t coalesce. If the show’s final season were to produce a kraken for Daenerys to fight on the way to Westeros, one would be confused, but hardly surprised."}

In 2019, Italy ’s and Spain ’s unemployment rates were around 9% and almost 14%, respectively. How would these countries be able to accommodate an influx of refugees during times of poor economic conditions? The newcomers require jobs to complete their integration, and it would be paradoxical for countries to commit to finding occupations for foreigners while their own citizens go jobless. As immigrants and unemployment affect each European country differently, not to mention France’s problem of immigrant-related terrorism , it seems unproductive for EU leaders to think a one-size-fits-all policy would work."}

The 1996 draft was the best draft as a whole since it introduced the largest number of quality players. Five of the first six picks were all-star players. Kobe Bryant, one of the greatest players to have ever played the game, was chosen as the 13th spot. Steve Nash, another NBA legend, was chosen as the 15th spot. The 1996 draft produced some of the best players , therefore it was the best draft ever."}

In these bars, gays could seek refuge from both systematic oppression – in the form of harsh anti-sodomy laws – and societal repression, in which gays were stigmatized and regular victims of violence. The term for these havens, where one could freely express personal or political preferences, was then broadly applied to other movements. Today’s safe spaces on university campuses, like cultural centers, carry this tradition forward, inviting students, especially minority students , to enjoy a space where phobias and biases are checked at the door."}

However, once they are tweens and teens , your children will begin to understand what a privilege overseas travel is and will become excited by the sights and cultures they encounter. This means that choices of destination can be more varied and exotic with older kids, as they’ll be more physically able to handle hiking to the top of volcanoes or scuba diving with dolphins. Also, giving your teens a taste of travel may lead them to volunteer abroad after high school, which is said to build character and impart vital skills."}
{"id": 1112, "content": "In an open relationship, one can seek multiple sexual partners while still being committed to their romantic partner. By now, humans have proven that we don’t just have sex to procreate. As it is an inherent part of most romantic relationships, many would argue that being sexually fulfilled is equally as important as being emotionally fulfilled. Open relationships may be an advantage to those couples who want to explore different experiences. In fact, around 12% of adults living in America were said to be involved with more than one sexual partner with their spouse’s consent. Experts suggest that we may be seeing a rise in poly relationships in the post-Covid era as a result of the desire for something (or someone) new – inside the bedroom and out. The stresses of the pandemic may have exposed faults of traditional marriage, including lowering partners’ libidos. Therefore, a consensual poly or open arrangement may rejuvenate or strengthen a strained marriage because each partner won’t furtively seek other experiences outside the relationship which often lead to infidelity in monogamous relationships."}

And, despite a brief halt in funding the World Health Organization under Trump, America has returned to being the organization’s top donor , contributing 24% of the WHO’s total budget.

This scene exemplifies that where poetry is pretty much accepted across the board as an established art form, Slam has yet to join the ranks of legitimacy in some of the public eye , because it’s an art form that doesn’t necessarily require talent or creativity."}

Testimonies like these are not uncommon; global studies estimate that “near-death” experiences are reported by an estimated 4-8% of the US population.

For instance, sources estimate that state and local governments spend around $29 billion on marijuana prohibition annually, with an additional $18 billion spent by the federal government. Meanwhile, full marijuana legalization would bring in $19 billion in state and local tax revenue and $39 billion in federal tax revenue. Clearly, the legalization of marijuana can cut government spending. This consequently saves resources for other societal uses (like finding a new approach to dealing with the country’s ongoing opioid crisis ). Not to mention, the legalization of marijuana can generate tax revenue that could go towards transferring income from drug producers and consumers to public funds."}

The fact is, whether abortion is a legal option will not alter women’s attempts to end unwanted or dangerous pregnancies by any means possible. The only difference is that legalizing abortion would enable women to do so safely, hygienically and with the least amount of risk to the woman and her fertile future. Legal restrictions lead women to attempt termination on their own or seek out the help of an unskilled service provider.

Arguably, classrooms are not an ideal place to negotiate one’s traumas. Safe spaces, both physical and intellectual, provide a low-pressure environment to do so, without drawing attention away from the lecturer or discussion. They have become increasingly important for students’ mental health . One sufferer of post-partum depression notes that safe spaces foster trust between marginalized and/or traumatized students with their schools, helping them to learn. Surprisingly, conservative and religious students have benefitted from these spaces, with professors at conservative colleges creating intellectual safe spaces through the use of trigger warnings that inform students when provocative material will be discussed."}

And while attitudes toward them are more lenient in the workplace than they were in the past, there are still prejudices that can affect one’s job prospects in certain places of employment. One survey found that 75% of the 2,675 respondents felt that tattoos hurt an applicant’s chances of being hired while 39% felt that employees with tattoos reflected poorly on the employer. And some tattooed employees may face company dress-code policies that make them cover up visible body art. For them, claiming their First Amendment Right to free speech won’t help them win any cases against employers. This is because the First Amendment only prevents governments from abridging someone’s freedom of speech and expression; it does not extend to private employers and certainly not to their prejudices."}

It had routinely used this Act before the pandemic to secure supplies for natural disaster relief and for the military.

For example, where it took a Samsung Galaxy S9 two minutes and 32 seconds to transcode a two-minute, 4K video, the iPhone X only required 42 seconds to get the job done. Apple’s 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max phones now include the A13 Bionic chip , which is the company’s most power efficient chip yet. So, in addition to speed, the phones also have 4-5 extra hours of battery life and a 20% performance boost.

His long history of speaking (or tweeting) very openly in public and saying just about anything that comes to mind are particularly well-timed when he needs to get back into the spotlight. Though it’s hard to beat his recent controversies, specifically his sporting a “ White Lives Matter ” shirt followed by anti-Semitic social media posts , probably his most famous outburst was in 2009 at the VMAs , which will always be remembered as the time he ruined Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech, making it all about him. He used the VMAs as his stage again six years later, when he went on a 20-minute rant saying he will be running for president in 2020 – which he made official on July 4, 2020. That same month, in an anti-abortion rant, he raised eyebrows when disclosing to the public that he and his ex-wife had initially considered aborting their first child. He has also publicly admitted to having an opioid addiction, and claimed black people “chose” slavery . As a result, the public finds itself talking oh-so-much about the versatile rapper – but for the wrong reasons.

Aside from the unfair economic disadvantage, Big Data fosters divisive lines between social classes. At least 7% of Americans aren’t online, and people from lower income levels don’t leave nearly as big a digital footprint as their wealthier counterparts.

Surreal memes are but one manifestation of internet insiders’ preoccupation with keeping memes out of the hands of mainstream internet users. Because surreal memes deliberately avoid cultural references of any kind, they are not easily consumed or absorbed into the internet mainstream. Unlike the art world’s Dadaism, which sought to translate the confusing of the times to anyone who looked upon a Dadaist piece, surrealist memes actively repel audiences by using content that will only resonate with a select group of internet insiders (go ahead, pretend you understand any of these ).

Through their actions, they managed to change cultural attitudes, put a stop to oppressive governmental policies (or sexist government policies, in the case of Ruth) and give voice to the underprivileged. Inspired by religion, these leaders, and many more like them, improved the lives of millions and changed the modern world for the better. On a smaller scale, religion provides positive meaning to many by instilling within them an outlook on life that is bigger than their day-to-day challenges or hardships."}

Given that some players shoot from such a large distance away from the basket (like the late Kobe Bryant did, and today’s Stephen Curry still does) that some suggest moving the 3-point line back or even applying a 4-point line .

The 1985 Chicago Bears were notorious for their impenetrable revolutionary defense, which played together from 1984 to 1986. They went 15-1 in the 1985 season, and won that year’s Super Bowl while setting an NFL record for 72 sacks, allowing only 10 points during the playoffs.

Also, although criticized as being sexist, Trump signed two bills aimed at promoting women in technology, science, mathematics and engineering, and allocated $200 million in education grants a year towards minorities and women who are interested in science.

It causes brain injury, memory loss, depression, dementia, liver disorder, addiction to painkillers and even suicide, all long after the blows have stopped. Showing the direct relation between these dire health consequences and playing football has changed the way lifelong fans now view NFL games. Many say it is now too difficult to watch the violence on the field without thinking about the human damage their favorite players may suffer as a direct consequence. Players themselves, even first-draft ones like Andrew Luck , are also saying “no more” to the physical pain from football-related injuries and retiring early. Fears of brain and other injuries and long-term damage, especially resulting from on-field concussions, have also affected younger players.

This is partially attributed to the fact that in the Asian diet, soybeans are usually consumed as whole foods; whether roasted, cooked, sprouted or fermented, soybeans have historically remained intact in their natural form over generations of Asian culinary traditions. In contrast, in Western diets, soy-based food is highly processed, meaning soybeans are rarely used in their whole form, thus their nutrients are stripped from them. So, to get the most out of your soy-based food, stick to soy that is not processed and therefore has higher nutritional benefits. Next time you’re at the supermarket, check food labels that say “whole soy” or “whole bean” among their ingredients."}

To regain its market share, Coca-Cola tried to literally sweeten the competition, transforming its product into New Coke . While this sweeter version failed , it made the company return to its roots, rebranding itself as Coca-Cola Classic and pushing its popular Diet Coke, to great success.

Society may call for public apologies, especially in cases of sexual misconduct, but it clearly still trades on power and publicity.

They deal with 250-300-pound titans ( most of whom can bench press over 500 lbs .) in an aggressive game that involves much more physical contact and collisions than basketball.

This way, objective results can be obtained, driving future upkeep. Otherwise, the tidying process would never be completed . This, in turn, creates a sense that the work is never-ending, which can lead to a subsequent lack of motivation. Sometimes, people need a new approach to tidying up to drive real change. Though extremely intensive, the KonMari Method may help accomplish this task as it forces you to transform your space quickly."}

For developers , publishing an unlimited number of apps through the Android marketplace is affordable at $25 – where iOS costs $99 for the same – and there is a higher percentage of free apps in Google Play Store than in the iOS App Store. This, combined with the fact that Android provides low-cost, quality handsets that are hundreds of dollars cheaper than iPhone’s newer models, makes the choice a simple one. The proof is in the numbers: Android holds almost 75% of market share around the world."}

Adding Puerto Rico to the U.S. state register would require these citizens residing and working in Puerto Rico to pay federal income taxes, significantly boosting the Federal Reserve’s annual revenues. This would also mean that American companies would no longer be able to move their businesses offshore to Puerto Rico to evade taxes , a current and significant problem in the U.S. Making Puerto Rico a state would limit accessible corporate corruption channels significantly. It might also make it easier to oversee and/or control how U.S. government funds are actually being utilized there and could prevent local government corruption."}

For instance, during each season of any professional sport, there are away games that keep players from their families. More significant, though, is that players put their bodies in danger daily. Physical injury can leave professional athletes handicapped or disabled for the rest of their lives; NFL players who experience multiple concussions can suffer from progressive degenerative disease that causes dementia and depression. Additionally, while most teenagers or college-age students spend their free time studying, working or hanging out, student athletes aiming to qualify for the pros spend all of their free time training. Thus, professional athletes’ salaries are a fair compensation for the countless time and energy they put into training and the huge health risks they take, especially considering that their careers typically end around the age of 35."}

Its economic growth has surpassed every other country’s at an average of 10% per year ; the sheer size of its population (over one billion people), combined with a growing middle class, has given the country unrivaled buying power . Consequently, American companies are itching to get involved. Facebook and Google have repeatedly tried to re-enter China, with each company changing policies and creating new products to try to get into the Chinese game. Some of Hollywood’s biggest films have also been reworked just for the chance of being allowed in, not to mention popular TV shows have been censored for fear of being critical of China."}

This suggests that war only became common as larger, sedentary civilizations emerged around 12,000 years ago. Many anthropologists dispute the notion that non-state societies today provide evidence that conflict is part of the human condition, accusing academics like Napoleon Chagnon of distorting results to suit their ideologies. Humans have been responsible for terrible acts of violence throughout our history, but the study of human cultures past and present shows that we are defined far more by cooperation and the avoidance of conflict than by violence.

Trolls reveal media’s propensity for sensationalism (and sometimes, a concerning lack of fact-checking) by getting mainstream news outlets to pick up fake stories. For example, ABC’s “Good Morning America” ran a story which claimed that Kanye West fans do not know who Paul McCartney is . More recently, the controversy surrounding Russia’s role in using trolls to spread fake news to interfere with the 2016 presidential elections has forced internet users to question what they read. Trolls thusly warn us be more cautious consumers of information, whether dealing with outlets big or small."}

The character’s 1960s sexist attitude toward women , and the movies’ over-reliance on gadgetry and focus on the Cold War felt outdated, especially next to moral spies like Ethan Hunt and Jason Bourne. Craig changed all that. He portrayed a never-before-seen emotional depth that moved Bond away from the slick, pretty-boy stereotype. Craig’s intensity and vulnerability , combined with his physical toughness gave viewers a darker, more interesting and psychologically complex James Bond than they’d ever seen before. Craig’s Bond perfectly balances ferocity and subtlety and shows that he’s capable of killing others and getting hurt emotionally. Craig humanized the Bond character, which no other actor before him did."}

To begin with, many parents don’t think that their adolescent children are emotionally or physically ready yet for sex. So, having schools introduce condom use to their teenagers pressures both the parents and teens into having conversations about sex that may feel premature. It may also interfere with a family’s values or religious beliefs. For instance, the Catholic Church and other conservative faiths oppose various forms of contraception. Parents who support the cause can provide condoms to their teenagers without having schools infringe on other families’ timelines of talking about sex and/or religious freedoms."}

Renting helps you generate an ongoing income source and can be part of an overall strategy to begin building wealth . Unlike other investments that need to be cashed in, owning real estate gives you money that you can use in real time (even to pay the mortgage on the property you rent out). After this money accumulates, it can be used to buy other properties and grow your investment portfolio. Also, putting aside Covid-19 , people still need homes to rent during times of economic unrest (as they may have trouble buying themselves), so your investment may even pay off in times of overall financial strain."}

While many parents voiced concern that the show would glamorize teen pregnancy, a poll taken amongst teens who watched the show suggested that nearly 90% felt the show had educated them about the realities of becoming a teen parent, and few felt that the topic had been glamorized. NBC’s The Biggest Loser , which ran for 17 seasons (!) made an unexpected contribution to science , providing a large test group of weight loss patients that have helped scientists to understand that metabolism plays a larger role in weight maintenance that exercise and diet. A show set out to address obesity in America ended up advancing the science of weight management more than it ever imagined."}

Fans’ morbid fascination with how bad the acting is in The Room doesn’t change the fact that viewers are left watching bad acting.

Sparked by Netanyahu’s leadership in confronting Iran, Sunni leaders started quietly coordinating with Israel on security issues, as the Iranian threat began to carry more resonance than Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians. While official diplomatic relations are still some ways off, Saudi officials now speak of accepting Israel as does Bahrain and the U.A.E .– unthinkable a generation ago. Half a century after fighting two devastating wars, Israel and Egypt have also seen their relations hit a high-water mark. While there won’t be a hint of peace between Israel and Syria any time soon, under Netanyahu, Israel has taken in and treated Syrian refugees from their civil war.

Or, since its 2015 debut, you could have enjoyed the brilliant Matilda or laugh-out-loud searing satire which is Book of Mormons .

Twenty years lager, his newly released “ Vulture 1 ” album features many artists, a testament to his popularity and longevity in the industry. Some critics say this latest album tarnishes his legacy while others deem it as a successful comeback that has saved not only his reputation but also his finances from bankruptcy. His other albums each experiment with a new or different style. His 2019 album, “ Jesus is King ,” shows this ability to explore new territory, reflecting his recent embrace of evangelical Christianity . He’s received 24 Grammy awards , outnumbering all other rap artists except for Jay-Z (who also has 24). Furthermore, West’s biggest influence is how he reinvents himself through every album. He isn’t afraid to take a concept to the extreme and mold new styles into the music industry.

This seems to work effectively, as a much higher percentage of mobile malware targets Android than iOS; one study found that 97% of all malware written in 2015 was geared towards Android, and another estimated that just 0.7% of threats were aimed at iOS. So, to answer whether iOS or Android, when choosing the right phone for you, it seems that iOS is the safer choice."}

Minaj appropriates an aggressively sexual male track, “ baby got back ,” and tells her female audience to care more about themselves than about society’s demands and beauty ideals. More importantly, she shows women that there is a difference between being sexy and being sexually available – and that sharing one’s time with others should be viewed by them as a privilege ."}

When we celebrate milestones of any kind, large or small, our bodies release endorphins that become strongholds against negative feelings and stimuli, and improve response to challenges. What is wonderful about prom is that it does not require any special success to merit celebration other than having arrived. For many teenagers, this dance may be the only moment of positive reinforcement and self-expression to fortify them before stepping into their next stage of life, where many challenges await. Prom provides students a model for seizing and appreciating life’s moments – a practice that, if internalized, will certainly make for happier adults. This especially rang true during the height of the pandemic, when parents tried to cheer up their disappointed high schoolers by making makeshift prom celebrations at home due to coronavirus restrictions."}

While the prevailing rhetoric of today’s breastfeeding camp would have you believe that bottle-fed children are disadvantaged, the fact is that millions of healthy humans have been raised on formula. In fact, in 2018, the US shot down a pro-breastfeeding resolution proposed by the World Health Assembly; the US argued that women should not be stigmatized for finding alternative ways to feed their babies if need be. It’s important to remember that just as today’s seeming preference for breastfeeding is rooted in culture as well as science, so was the mid-twentieth century’s preference for bottle-feeding. Bottle-feeding was a symbol of scientific parenting and modernity, and parents were eager to embrace it. As formula is becoming even more scientifically advanced, there is no real reason to prefer one method over the other."}

As users can open and operate multiple fake Twitter accounts, it is easy for anyone to claim to be someone else – impersonating people to either spread fake news or hurt others. In fact, it’s easier to create a fake personality on Twitter than on other social media platforms, since it demands much less visual evidence of users’ private lives. Take feminist writer Lindy West , who was stalked and harassed by a fellow Twitter user pretending to be her deceased dad. Even those who don’t hide behind fake profiles can troll others, taunting users with abusive, racist and anti-Semitic tweets. The former US president himself was also known to make offensive tweets . Even before the Jan. 6 riots , Twitter, which was used by protestors to encourage participation in events that day, had already started making efforts to mitigate cyberbullying and tweets that were perceived to potentially encourage or glorify violence . However, the platform is challenging to monitor; it’s often healthier for innocent victims to close their Twitter accounts."}

Guevara’s biographer recorded him as the “Scion of the Soviet Union,” and the Soviet Ambassador to Cuba called him “the vital link to Cuba.” Guevara’s vision of the future saw Cuba breaking free of its sugar export and branching out into global industry. However, the Soviets did not hold the respect for Cuba’s future that Guevara’s vision called for, using them only as a pawn for closer proximity to the US. This allowed the Soviet Union missile trade, which led to the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1961 and, eventually, the Cold War. Guevara’s efforts to ally with the Soviets actually created more problems than solutions for Cuba, and in turn, the Western World."}

As radiologist Richard Gunderman points out, “The fact that an injury is unfixable does not necessarily give us license to give up on it.” Physicians handle life-and-death situations every day, not to be the deciders of who shall live and who shall die, but to give life the upper hand when death waits at the doorstep."}

Meanwhile, the three million Palestinians living in the West Bank are also subject to different laws , depending upon whether they are under the legal jurisdiction of Israel or the Palestinian Authority (PA) – which is decided by geographic area.

However, once in the mainstream, the real bodies celebrated by the original movement were replaced by “plus sized” models. Nowadays, the “ideal body” is still out of reach for most who are striving for “the new perfect.” In a movement that once accompanied all bodies and all colors, the #BoPo hashtag can be seen alongside a lululemon outfit. #celebrateallwomen?

For example, without knowing the real history of the Marquis de Sade, all his stories are just adolescent fantasies.

{"id": 1193, "content": "Religion often plays a role in how we see ourselves, and it can serve as an unyielding measuring stick. Defining oneself according to religion has to do with how willing you are to let go of Earthly distractions in return for eternal rewards. On this scale, an individual’s interpretation of the Scriptures can lead him or her to seclusion, if others don’t understand or relate to it. In addition, avoiding Earthly pleasures requires a strictness (some might even say harshness) that some devoutly religious people can inflict on those around them. For instance, it can be refusing vaccines for religious reasons, or parents denying medical treatment for their kids, or a cult leader using the Bible to justify ungodly acts. In this regard, religion can be too easily used to manipulate people who are in great need.

Without Friends and its focus on friendship (as opposed to career or love – not to mention its redefining the concept of family), there would be no How I Met Your Mother, New Girl or even The Big Bang Theory , among others. Given the premise of Friends (see argument #1), which had 40-50 more episodes than Seinfeld , the show has also aged better than Seinfeld . Besides, the numbers don’t lie: Netflix paid some $100M to stream the series for 12 months, citing that it was the second-most watched program among American viewers in 2018."}

For most upstanding citizens, owning a gun is as important to them as maintaining freedom of speech, the press, religion, among others. In fact, three quarters of gun owners believe that the right to bear arms is paramount to their freedom. No wonder gun owners take it personally when gun control laws appear to infringe on this right, thus impeding efforts to acquire firearms and protect themselves and their families. Plus, there’s the risk that certain proposed background checks may require government databases to keep gun owners’ personal information indefinitely. This could lead to future database searches unrelated to the information when it was first collected. This understandably can be perceived as an unfair invasion of privacy."}

Some prostitutes marvel at their great financial success and draw feelings of “empowerment” from their work. Stories of satisfied practitioners and customers beg the question: Why isn’t prostitution simply viewed as a normal business transaction? As the great variation in prostitution laws across the globe reflects, the illicit nature of prostitution is by no means an objective reality. And even if the ethical parameters of prostitution are unclear, free societies should, in principle, avoid restricting business transactions that do not harm individuals or society."}

Therefore, classing obesity as a disease may inadvertently steer treatment toward drugs and gastrointestinal surgeries, for a condition that can often be overcome (albeit less easily) through diet and exercise. Worse, it may diminish an obese person’s sense of control over their weight, and effectively discourage behavioral changes that contribute to weight loss."}

Throughout the 20th century, his techniques of dream analysis and free association profoundly impacted the Surrealists , like Salvadore Dali, among others. They drew inspiration from Freud’s theories, embracing the subconscious, the dreamlike and free association in their artistic expressions. Freud also wrote essays on famous artworks, including The Moses of Michelangelo , and even published an entire book on Leonardo da Vinci , exploring the artist’s childhood, sexuality and how they informed his art as an adult. Freud’s essays showed unparalleled analysis and observation, which explains why he posthumously won the Goethe Prize , Germany’s greatest literary prize, in 1930. His ability to clearly express ideas for people across the sciences and the arts is a testament to Freud’s unique ability to bridge the gap between intricate psychological concepts and the broader artistic community."}

Additionally, chickens create eggs more quickly than other animals do, but they need the protein to help speed up the process. In other words, it is impossible for a chicken egg to form unless it has emerged from within a hen’s body."}

Every driver has a good chance of winning, rather than following what often seems to be a pre-determined hierarchy in Formula 1. Without a major technological advantage, NASCAR drivers’ talent is on full display. No one simply wins because their machine is faster. NASCAR drivers never stop duelling each other for every inch, with a takeover possible at any moment. In fact, in Formula 1, overtaking is frustratingly rare because the cars’ aerodynamics make doing so incredibly difficult. Whereas vehicles like those in NASCAR create a slipstream that gives those behind them a slight speed advantage, Formula 1 cars are designed to prevent this. Often one of them holds pole position for the whole duration of the race, making the outcome more predictable and therefore less exciting."}

This is just one of many examples where misinformation can do serious damage to innocent people. Similarly, in the wake of the 2013 Boston Marathon tragedy, Reddit’s now infamous FindBostonBombers subreddit thread took to scanning pictures of the marathon, and it quickly became open season on young males with dark hair and backpacks.

Dialysis, a common treatment for kidney failure, costs an average of $72,000 per year, per patient. With nearly 500,000 individuals on dialysis in the US, it constitutes a significant cost burden for individuals, insurance companies, and the government. Sources estimate that obesity costs the US health system $173 billion a year . By defining obesity as a disease, cost-effective treatments for obesity – like consultations with a nutritionist, physical therapy, or even bariatric surgery – can help to circumvent cases (and therefore costs) of the diseases with which obesity is associated. As the old adage goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. As such, in the works are federal, evidenced-based dietary guidelines for infants, pregnant women and young children in an effort to prevent obesity."}

However, antidepressants are one of the most effective treatments for mental illnesses, and should be a resource that is well-considered.

The Human Rights Council has also faced repeated criticism over allowing member countries who themselves have a history of human rights abuses (such as Russia and China, among others) – a fact which prompted the US to temporarily withdraw from the committee in 2018 , not for the first time.

{"id": 1220, "content": "While affirmative action was intended to help those with a history of suffering prejudice, racial discrimination isn’t properly rectified when favoring one group (minorities) over another (whites). In fact, biased selection policies may fuel resentment and stigmatization towards minorities from those who believe they hold position in the workplace or university due to policy rather than merit. Moreover, the Supreme Court’s recent decision to end affirmative action was fueled by the majority opinion that schools’ programs “unavoidably employ race in a negative manner” and “involve racial stereotyping.” Therefore, affirmative action programs may actually appear as more of an insult to underprivileged groups than an asset. This is especially the case when whites and other groups feel like their own rights – or chances of admissions at top schools like Yale – are being violated."}

The Constitution’s 8th and 14th Amendments recognize the death penalty BUT under due process of the law. This means that certain legal requirements must first be fulfilled before any state executions can be legally carried out – even when pertaining to the cruelest, most cold-blooded murderer .

This is a process which is both time consuming and costly. Rent fluctuations are especially onerous for retirees on fixed income, making the lifelong process of acquiring a home well worth the effort. More than avoiding unpredictable raises in rental fees, homeowners know which schools their children will attend, and they and their family have the ability to form deep ties with their neighbors and community.

Children, more emotionally vulnerable than adults by nature, should not be exposed to this sort of pressure. This is especially true in situations where the child is being paid for their performance, since the added necessity to perform well can lead to even more pressure.

In some cases, these physical problems can be fatal; e.g., Julissa Gomez, who died from complications of a vaulting injury contracted when she was 15 in warm-ups for a gymnastics competition. Actors and dancers are usually encouraged to stay thin, often to an unhealthy degree. Because children are particularly vulnerable, they are more susceptible to the perils of over-exercising for athletes and eating disorders for performers. It has been found, for example, that girls who dance in their childhood are more likely than their peers to develop anorexia nervosa in later life. With the damage eating disorders can do to a person’s body, it should be illegal to expose children to such risks."}

{"id": 1235, "content": "The career path of celebrities is unusual in that it accretes over time on the basis of the performers standing in the public mind. Unlike other professions this does not lend itself to taking two years out of the limelight, especially years when fame is coming to its height. The media is notoriously fickle and equally well-known for having a short memory. It generally struggles to stay interested in a celebrity if they’re out of the limelight for more than a few weeks. It is simply unfeasible that they would remain interested when someone has been out of the spotlight for over two years. In effect this means that for a Korean musician or actor their career will finish at the age of 29. In other profession it is possible to build a career around national service and employers know that at some point any young man they employ will need to undertake their military service but celebrities simply aren’t employed in this way."}

Nobody would suggest that members of other professions should be expected to interrupt it when they are at the height of their profession. In reality for most people this would be when they are in their fifties. For professions like acting and music this tends to be the late twenties and early thirties. Indeed, for pop singers in particular their career is likely to be over when they are 35. In the light of this setting the age limit where it is is uniquely unfair to performers – just as it is to athletes. Military service anywhere in the world is considered to be something you undertake before your career, not in the middle of it. Regulations should reflect reality, in this instance that means allowing performers to get on with their careers."}

{"id": 1239, "content": "Trade does not exist in a vacuum. It needs a wider infrastructure to support it, e.g. roads, railways, ports, education to produce capable civil servants to administer trading rules, etc. For example Malawi as a landlocked country needs roads and railways to link it to ports in neighboring Angola and Mozambique. Without foreign aid, developing countries are not able to develop this kind of support, and so cannot participate effectively in international trade. This is even more the case when it comes to creating the necessary legal infrastructure and effective civil service. Aid is not always in the form of money - it may also be given through expert advisors who help countries prepare for the challenges of globalization. Such were the efforts in the 1960s by the developing world, but they were dropped in favor of poverty relief. If restarted and restructured, they would yield much better results, without the fear of commodity prices dropping, enabling African countries to eventually stand on their own two feet. Corruption is a potentially huge problem as recognized by Sudan People’s Liberation Movement Secretary General Pagan Amum \"We will have a new government with no experience at governing. Our institutions are weak or absent. There will be high expectations. Hundreds of millions of dollars of oil money will be coming our way, as well as inflows of foreign aid.

Through a ban on advertisement or higher taxation those citizens not involved in active educational structures get educated about the problem. Studies on the ban of advertisements show that bans actually contribute great amounts to the reduction of smokers. \"The tobacco industry employs predatory marketing strategies to get young people hooked to their addictive drug,\" said Dr Douglas Bettcher, Director of WHO's Tobacco Free Initiative. \"But comprehensive advertising bans do work, reducing tobacco consumption by up to 16% in countries that have already taken this legislative step. \"1 So because these measures can drastically decrease smoking when other measures have failed, the state is right to impose bans on advertisement, higher prices or any other measures."}

Due to the maximization of an individual's happiness the government should only have the possibility to give information to their citizens and let them all decide, how they want to make use of their freedom of choice. One of the options is a targeted campaign against smoking and information on smoking harms. Actually, the National Bureau for Economic research states that there has not been enough investment in counteradvertising, which is designed to reduce consumption and also fits into the framework of a response function. \"The counteradvertising response function slopes downward and is subject to diminishing marginal product. The levels of counteradvertising that have been undertaken are small in comparison to advertising.

It goes by the principle, that the individual is free to do, whatever he or she wants, as long as this choice does not limit the freedom of choice, bodily integrity or any other human right of another individual in society. This also applies to smoking. While the law steps in to prevent citizens causing harm to others, whether deliberately or accidentally it should not stop those taking risks themselves. The state allows individuals to make lifestyle choices that endanger their life all the time. Because there is not difference between smoking and the other life endangering activities, banning or severely regulating smoking would be an unmerited intrusion into personal freedom."}
{"id": 1245, "content": "Sentience is the property of being conscious. Sentience brings with it the ability to experience. There is a massive difference in the way that we treat sentient and non-sentient beings instinctively. We see nothing wrong with forming relationships with one’s pets but we tend to deem people with emotional relationships to objects mentally ill. Here we are talking about something more than sentimentality but rather the kind of relationship in which one is concerned with the other party’s emotional wellbeing. We even feel concerned about the wellbeing of sentient beings which whom we do not have a personal connection. For example we may feel upset when we see a dog run over on the road. This would be a very difficult reaction to how we might feel if we see an object crushed by a car. We feel moral outrage at the clubbing of seals. The instinctive way which we differentiate between these two categories relates to the type of value they have. Whilst objects have value because of how they affect us - e.g. they are useful or remind us of a good time or person – we believe that animals have intrinsic value. This means that a sentient being must never be treated as a means rather than an end in and of itself. Therefore, animals must not be treated as a means to an end but as intrinsically valuable."}
{"id": 1246, "content": "Just as racism is wrongful discrimination against beings of a different race and sexism is wrongful discrimination against a being of a different gender, speciesism is wrongful discrimination against a being of a different species. Wrongful discrimination occurs when there is no other reason for the discrimination except the mere fact that the being is of the race, sex, or species that they are. For example, if an employer refuses to employ a black woman over a white woman because she has an inferior qualification this is justified discrimination whereas if he refuses to employ the black woman simply because she is black then this is wrongful discrimination. Human beings are speciesist towards animals because we sacrifice their most important needs for our trivial desires: their life for our enjoyment of a burger. You might think that we are allowed to have special relationships to people that are similar to us but there is a difference between special relationships and being active cruel and discriminatory. Our evolutionary instinct to protect our own species may not be ethically correct in contemporary society. Similarly, we ought not to 'put down' animals who are too expensive to care for. We do not allow human beings to kill off their children when they experience financial difficulty because we believe that human beings value their lives. It would be justifiable to kill off something that has no interest in living, such as a plant, but since we believe that animals do have an interest in living it would be speciesist to kill off a puppy simply because it is not human. We know that society believes animals have an interest in living sometimes because there is outcry when baby seals are clubbed or when elephants are poached for their ivory. Yet at other times we are happy to eat animal flesh and wear leather. This is a contradictory stance. We ought to be consistent in our views and to condemn speciesists. Refusing animals rights is speciesist. Therefore, it is wrong to deny animals rights."}
{"id": 1247, "content": "It is true that animals and human beings are different. It is also true that men are different from women and children from adults. Equality does not require beings to be identical. It is true that whilst many people argue women should have the right to abortion, no one argues the same for men because men are unable to have an abortion. It is similarly true that whilst most people believe all human beings have a right to vote, no one argues that animals deserve a right to vote – even those who support animal rights. Equality does not mean that beings all deserve the exact same treatment. It means rather that we consider equally the equal interests of animals and humans. If we deem amount A to be the maximum amount of suffering a person be allowed to endure, then that should apply equally to an animal, though humans and animals may suffer different amounts under different circumstances. The principle of equality advocates equal consideration, so it still allows for different treatment and different rights. Equality is a prescriptive rather than a descriptive concept. What’s important is that beings should ONLY be treated differently where there is a morally relevant difference between them. For example, we can justifiably deny dogs the right to vote because there is a relevant difference in intelligence between dogs and humans. However, there is no justification for battery-farming chickens who have a capacity to suffer. There is evidence that they experience fear, pain and discomfort. Although chickens may be less intelligent and unable to speak , these differences are not morally relevant to whether or not they should be placed in these conditions. We ought to consider animals equally to the way we consider humans. If we were to do so we would give animals rights. We ought therefore to give animals rights."}

This means that we may not treat animals in such a manner that our actions are in conflict with our duties towards human beings. A human has no duty towards a dog not to kick it but a human has a duty towards the dog's owner not to damage his property. Pigs and cows are not loved by any human being so we cause no harm when we kill and eat them. Though the farmer may have owned the cow before, the beef becomes our possession when we purchase it. Wild animals are not owned by any human being so we may do to them what we wish. Some people argue that cruelty towards animals can lead to cruelty towards humans but there is no evidence that people who work in slaughterhouses are more violent towards other people. In fact, there seems little connection at all between how people treat animals and humans. A slave driver may adore and pamper his dog but beat and kill his slaves. If we have no direct duties to animals how can we grant them legal protection in the form of rights? The law should only prevent us harming animals when that clearly harms other people. For example, by killing a dog we infringe another person's human right to property."}

What exactly an undignified action might be for an animal it is difficult to say. The right to education, to vote, to fair trial, to be innocent until proven guilty, to privacy, marriage, nationality, religion, property, freedom of thought, freedom of speech, workers rights and shelter all seem impossible to apply to animals.

The duty to respect means that governments cannot block access for people wishing to use the internet to express themselves. The duty to protect means government should prevent others from interfering with internet users and the duty to fulfil could easily be taken just a little bit further to having to provide access to the internet. Freedom of expression therefore covers a freedom to access the internet as it already provides for a freedom to access mediums to express ones’ self."}

We are charged more to be able to download more, in effect to have greater access to this human right. There has never been any suggestion that the equally great media advances of TV and telephones are technologies worthy of being considered a human right.

In such a case the only argument for a right to the internet is that it faster to access the information through the internet than it would be to look it up in the books that are all around. There cannot therefore be considered to be a right to the internet even as part of any right to information because the right to information would simply require that a government provides access to this information not that it has to be via the internet. Moreover as an enabling technology it is quite possible that the internet may at some point be out of date and replaces by some new method of storing information.

For example The Institute for Policy Innovation believes the global music industry loses $12.5 billion a year due to piracy resulting in 71,060 lost jobs.

This is all about protecting the commercial interest of those corporations that have ceased to have much to do with any of these processes and simply want to make the most out of what they already control through copyright. It is and remains profoundly anti-competitive and a retrograde step in terms of developing any artistic, scientific or intellectual field.

It lets repressive regimes know the entire world is watching them, that they cannot simply massacre their people with impunity, and it creates evidence for potential prosecutions if they do.

It is simply a basic principle of the Internet that for it to continue working as it does now, all data needs to be treated the same otherwise judgements will be formed on ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ data . The principle here is that the data being used is simply none of the ISPs business. Their job is simply to provide an agreed bandwidth, at an agreed price to the end user. How the end user makes use of that band width is up to them.

This way both the data gluttons and the dieters get what they want. The gluttons get a fast provision of the resources they want or the capacity to share those resources at a reasonable speed and the dieters get cheaper provision. Measures being pursued by the European Commission aim to do exactly this. They will allow ISPs to control the passage of data across their networks but must, at the same time, make it clear what they are doing and offer low data use price plans accordingly . This is more so with mobile devices than with ‘plumbed in’ ones. For many people, it wouldn’t occur to them to use Skype for a call and a phone – even a smart one – is primarily just that, a phone.

If you compel net neutrality then, say, the ISP who caters for religious customers can no longer deliver the service that they have requested.

If, for example, a nation’s aid budget is cut or redirected, why should the citizens of the affected nation not have a right to know why ? If, as is frequently the case, it has happened because of an action or inaction by their own government, then it is important that they know.

As a result all they have to do is wait it out until the attention of the media turns elsewhere to ensure that if evidence of misconduct or culpability were found, it would probably be buried as a minor story if not lost altogether.

So, when humans start taking drugs to improve performance, it is no longer a sport, it is a spectacle, because there is no human physical achievement, but instead a chemical achievement.

The need for the state is especially keen here due to the pressure to take risks put on matadors and others by the audience and the bullfighting community, which may lead many of them to take risks, and suffer injuries, they otherwise would not, for fear of losing 'face'.

With instant replay, we would not have had Jim Joyce, the umpire who blew Galarraga’s perfect game, holding a tearful press conference apologizing for his missed call.

Jennings claims that this type of rap/ hip hop music is 'telling people And that's exactly how society is treating us'1. She continues that images of women 'tends to be objectified, degrading, very stripper-like' or as nagging vicious and manipulative money grabbers1. Jennings' worry is that in these videos women are depicted as menial, subservient and purely as the object of men's entertainment. The lyrics that go with these music videos compound these ideas of women as undeserving of male respect e.g. 'wouldn't piss on fire to put you out' (Eminem), 'Then I straight smoked the ho and she thanked me' (NWE) (All lyrics in full are in the scrapbook). These images in themselves are violence towards women, as they dehumanise them. As this becomes a dominant image in society, young people who look up to these rappers mimic their behaviour and believe it is ok to disrespect women,2 as that is what they have been exposed to. This works in the same way for young girls, who cannot relate to the male rappers and so instead mimic the women they talk about, while also following their views on women. This idea that women are not deserving of respect must affect the levels of violence towards women as if you abuse someone you cannot fully respect them. Therefore if music depicting violence (and for this argument, disrespect) towards women was banned, then violence towards women in the real world would be reduced and this must be seen as a good thing."}

They marry because marriage symbolizes a long-term commitment to one another, not a pledge to reproduce for the state or humanity as a whole. In any case, gay couples may adopt children in countries where they are permitted to do so, revealing society's view at large that homosexual couples can readily act as capable parents and provide loving home environments. Furthermore, the advance of medical science has also enabled same-sex couples to have children of their own through surrogate mothers and sperm donors. It can no longer be said that homosexual couples should not be granted the right to marriage because, either, they cannot have children, or that they cannot raise children adequately.

All registrars who refused to marry homosexual couples could be fired. There could be no difference in the process or the paperwork required for either a heterosexual or homosexual marriage. The dismissal of discriminating registrants would have a legal precedent in the charges brought upon hotel owners who refused gay couples and adoption agencies who refused to deal with gay couples."}

That is why a position like agnosticism makes no sense. There are no agnostics on the subject of unicorns; there are only agnostics on the subject of God because people tend to be reticent to say they are atheists due to the prevalence of belief of God even in the most secular societies. But fantasy is fantasy, and an agnostic is really just an atheist by another name. Were someone to claim that dragons exist, the person he told it to would not be justified responding saying he did not know whether they exist and that it must be an open question until evidence is presented to corroborate the claim. That is how reasoning works. Thus agnosticism is a philosophically meaningless position. There is either belief or lack of belief, atheism or theism. Opponents of atheism seeking to hide in the nebulous realm of agnosticism, or who claim that because one cannot know there is no God one must be agnostic, hold a position that is philosophically bankrupt."}

For example communities could provide basic healthcare but could they provide the cutting edge research necessary to improve it, and then the expensive treatments to be able to take advantage of that research? Legal systems are dependent on the state for their existence, without a centralised system of law and a state to appoint judges and organise and fund courts and the police.

{"id": 1305, "content": "'Credit bubbles' and resultant credit crunches (financial crisis) are inherent in the capitalist system. The economy undergoes a crisis whenever productive economic sectors begin to undergo a slowdown resulting in falls in profits. The recent crisis was caused due to the fact that there was an inflated investment in real estates. It was invested in with the purpose of keeping up profits which lead to a rise in the price of properties. Because of the increased price in property many people took out loans on their house and bought goods for the credit, thinking they could easily pay back their loans since their house would be more valuable at sale. However, since the rise of price was fabricated and not corresponding to an actual need (it was a bubble), house prices had to invariably go down at some point. When the prices eventually went down people could no longer afford to pay back what they had bought on their loaned houses and the installed payments were the trigger of the financial crisis. It could perhaps be said that the economy was surviving on money which did not exist (thereof the name 'credit bubble'). The result was that there were countless goods which no one could buy because no one could afford to pay for them, in turn this lead to a stagnation in the economy and hence to a crisis. A socialist system would not produce overconsumption since its aim is not profit but human needs, it would not have a reason to fabricate an investment for the sake of keeping up the profits and would therefore not cause a capitalist crisis1.

If the law penalizes anyone who has ever smoked then it would not provide nearly as strong an incentive to stop smoking.

{"id": 1311, "content": "Blasphemy laws can be used to enforce oppressive and exclusionary practices within religions. The proposition side have gone out of their way to highlight the harm that can be done to religions by actors external to the religious group. However, this analysis does not fit so comfortably with the problems that occur when a member of a religious community wishes to make controversial and divisive statements about their own religion. Dissenters within a religious group may often face exclusion from their communities and hostility from friends and family. The current law of western liberal democracies ensures that social disapproval does not transform into threats or violent conduct directed at these individuals. In this way, liberal democratic states recognise the right to speak freely without fear of violent or disproportionate repercussions, irrespective of the social and cultural standards enforced by the community that an individual might belong to. By criminalising blasphemy, proposition run the risk of discouraging religious dissent within religious communities. Heterodox thinkers who want to share their views on their religion with other believers, must now run the dual risks of effective exile from a social environment that they consider to be their home and prosecution by the state. Anti-blasphemy laws would give communities the ability to indirectly harm and intimidate anyone holding controversial opinions, by directing state power- in the form of prosecutors and the police- against them. Further, anti-blasphemy laws might simply discourage free expression of this type, the prospect of prosecution being sufficient to discourage controversial statements and discussions. Religions- even if based on divine revelation- develop through human debate, thought and discussion. The proposition position would harm the development of religions if it were realised. It would balance the environment of collective discourse within a religion in favour of conservative and reactionary thinkers. It should also be noted that it is the state which drafts the law and its organs then apply it, deciding which cases will or will not be prosecuted. It might be enforced unevenly by the government, thus favouring certain religions and victimizing others. It could be used to limit the expression of unpopular ideas, which are the ones that need the most protection, as has happened in the past with the work of artists criticizing the social and political mores of the time with previous cases showing their books being banned from libraries or their paintings from art galleries. Take for example the banning of Salman Rushdie’s novel The Satanic Verses in numerous states around the world."}

Some degree of public control over the content of hip hop will also help to preserve the diversity, accessibility of the genre in the face of commercial dominance by violent forms of rap. Mainstream success in hip hop has become synonymous with gangsta rap, and with artists who have backgrounds that lend veracity to their lurid verses. However, many of these supposedly “authentic” experiences consist of little more than exaggeration and invented personas. When being interviewed about the controversial content of her son’s single “Fuck tha’ police”, the mother of rapper Ice Cube commented that “I don’t see saying those curse words. I see him like an actor.” The existence of pornography attests to the market for forms of media that fulfil base and simplistic human fantasies. Much the same can be said for the violent and cynical content of rap singles. Unlike the relationship between cinema and pornography, however, many commentators appear to regard gangsta rap as being synonymous with hip hop – a position as deceptive as a film critic claiming that all movies are inevitably tied to pornography. The significant public profile and poor regulation of hip hop have meant that gangsta rap fans have become the genre’s dominant class of consumer. The amount of money that fans are willing to spend on singles, albums, concert tickets and associated branded goods means that labels that cultivate relationships with gangsta rappers have become the gatekeepers of the hip hop genre in general. Either consciously, or by design, the terrain of contemporary hip hop is hostile to musicians who are not prepared to discuss “guns, bitches and bling” in their work. This constitutes a significant barrier to rappers ability to communicate novel messages and listeners’ ability to receive them. It could be called a market failure – the pervasive public presence of gangsta rap has effectively denied an audience to other rappers. Classification has the potential to maximise the freedom and effectiveness of musical expression by hip hop artists who choose not to trade in brutality and misogyny. The alternative is to allow hip hop to continue to be dominated by businesses such as Death Row Records, Low Life Records and Machete Music. This will lead to hip hop as a medium becoming inextricably linked with violent lyrics and the dubious businesses practices of gangsta labels’ bosses. Popular disengagement is much more likely under these circumstances, and will actively deny a voice, and opportunities, to musicians with a different perspective on hip hop."}

We now know the chemical properties of most substances, and powerful computers allow us to predict the outcome of chemical interactions. Experimenting on live tissue culture also allows us to gain insight as to how living cells react when exposed to different substances, with no animals required. Even human skin leftover from operations provides an effective medium for experimentation, and being human, provides a more reliable guide to the likely impact on a human subject.

Animals too express some of these characteristics to some degree and thus animals too are worthy of moral consideration. However, animal lives and human lives are of unequal value. This is due to the fact that no animal possesses all of these characteristics to the same degree as the average human, or even comes particularly close. Thus any rights ascribed to animals should be truncated relative to the rights we ascribe to humans. To the extent to which causing some harm to animals brings great benefit to humans, we are morally justified in creating some moral harm, to achieve a far greater moral good."}

Even according to the proposition this represents about a quarter of all new drugs released, which could be seen as significant given the great potential to relieve the suffering beyond our current capacity that such drugs promise. After the effects, side effects and more complex interactions of a drug have been confirmed using animal and non-animal testing, it will usually pass to what is called a phase I clinical trial - tests on human volunteers to confirm how the drug will interact with human physiology and what dosages it should be administered in. The risk of a human volunteer involved in a phase I trial being harmed is extremely small, but only because animal tests, along with non-animal screening methods are a highly effective way of ensuring that dangerous novel drugs are not administered to humans. In the United Kingdom, over the past twenty years or more, there have been no human deaths as a result of phase I clinical trials. Novel compounds (as opposed to so-called \"me-too\" drugs, that make slight changes to an existing treatment) are the substances that hold the most promise for improving human lives and treating previously incurable conditions. However, their novelty is also the reason why it is difficult for scientists to predict whether they may cause harm to humans. Research into novel compounds would not be possible without either animal testing, or tremendous risk to human subjects, with inevitable suffering and death on the part of the trial volunteers on some occasions. It is difficult to believe that in such circumstances anyone would volunteer, and that even if they did, pharmaceutical companies would be willing to risk the potential legal consequences of administering a substance to them they knew relatively little about. In short, development of novel drugs requires animal experimentation, and would be impossible under the proposition's policy."}

Many animals, and indeed humans, die untimely deaths that are due to reasons other than old age, animal experimentation may increase these numbers slightly but so long as the animals are treated well there should be no moral objection to animal research.

Deprivation of liberty and the emptiness of criminal life are seen as retribution for criminals' dishonest or violent activities. Politicians dare not confront the damaging effects of imprisonment for fear of being labelled as \"soft\" on crime. There is greater political cache to be gained from introducing policies that prolong prison terms, and remove judges' discretion to order non custodial sentences. Novel approaches to the problem of criminality are seen as signs of political weakness. The use of monitored corporal punishment will keep offenders who have not committed serious crimes out of the prison system. At a nominal rate of five lashes for every year of incarceration, flogging will serve as a clear demonstration of societal disapproval, satisfying popular conceptions of retributive \"justice\". Once the need to punish is satisfied, policy makers will be free to institute new rehabilitation schemes that address the root causes of criminal behaviour; these schemes can be set up without sacrificing political capital or appearing to prioritise the rights of criminals over victims or the public."}

The majority of western liberal democracies are party to inter-governmental and supranational agreements that expressly forbid states from using torture or degrading or inhuman punishments in any capacity. The mark of a modern, liberal state is that it uses authority and engagement rather than raw power to protect its citizens. The use of force or power by the state and its agents is harder to regulate and costlier to compensate when it is misapplied. Liberal democracies, apart from being agents of realpolitik, are also aspirational bodies that should strive to reflect and adhere to the values they were created to defend. Arbitrary, coercive force and violence is one of the core harms that a state must guard against. Violence is said to be the preserve of criminals and those acting against the values of society. Therefore, as an aspirational body, the state should hold itself to a higher standard of behaviour than such individuals. Violence, as most liberal constitutions make clear, should only ever be employed by the state as a last resort. Where a state has the means to do so, even if those means are costly or politically contentious, it should endeavour to achieve peace and order within its own borders without wielding power. At its broadest, the liberal democratic ideology holds that the rights and autonomy of individual citizens should be only be infringed in order to protect the rights and autonomy of other citizens. This principle would be violated if the state resorted to corporal sentencing as a way of satisfying a mob-like demand for visible and harsh criminal sentencing. No citizen of a liberal democracy has a right to demand that another citizen, criminal or not, should be subjected to unnecessary pain and suffering by the state."}

This is known as ‘chasing losses’. It results in people staking more and more money, most of which they will lose, and sinking deeper and deeper into debt.

Moreover when a gambler is in debt and wishes to continue gambling due to its addictive nature, he or she often turns to loan sharks as no bank would lend to them. Casinos can therefore be devastating to neighborhoods. It would of course be wrong to assume all gamblers are criminals, although there is an increased possibility that gamblers in debt could turn to criminality through illegal borrowing. These loan sharks themselves usually have links to organized crime, in some cases are actually run by organized crime,2 and use brutal methods to reclaim their money. By banning gambling the opportunities for loan sharks to offer their services is greatly reduced due to a lesser amount of gamblers in debt, as are the opportunities for prostitutes therefore reducing criminal activity in the areas surrounding casinos.

Games with violent content are often easily acquired by players too young to purchase them. They may also gain access to them at home from older siblings. Because children do not have fully developed mental faculties yet, and may not clearly separate fantasy from reality, exposure to violent games can have a large impact upon children. This has a greater impact than children seeing films that feature realistic violence because whilst a child might get bored with films owing to the lack of interaction with the medium, this is much less likely to be the case with, for example, a military shooting game, which a child might play over and over As such, all violent video games should be banned to prevent their acquisition by young children either by accident, or owing to parental ignorance.

{"id": 1346, "content": "In the digital age, young people are almost certain to be exposed to violent media content, including violent video games, even if parents attempt to restrict children’s exposure to such content in the home. Parents therefore have an obligation to educate themselves about video games (many government, industry and private websites provide such information) and to help their children become “media literate” regarding the content and context of games. The state places responsibility on parents for the welfare of a child and in doing so the state can allow things that would potentially be dangerous for children, anything from skateboards to R-rated films, as long as parents can supervise their children. Parents need not know how to skateboard to supervise such activity, but should know about potential risks and safety equipment. This same logic applies to video games. To not confer this responsibility on parents is to further undermine their status as role models for their children, as it assumes that parents are incapable of ensuring the safety of their children. Practically speaking, this could affect the respect they get from their children, with “The government says I can’t,” being a much weaker response when questioned about violent video games than an actual explanation of the harms behind them."}

There have been court cases that have confirmed that force feeding should be allowed when a patient is considered mentally ill. For example the case of “ B  vs.   Croydon Health Authority ” in 1994 it was judged, that B (a borderline personality disorder patient, which involves suffering from an irresistible desire to inflict-self-harm) can be force fed, even though she did not give consent to the treatment.

Exposure to violent video games causes aggressive thoughts and feelings. It also creates unwanted psychological arousal and belief in a 'scary world', especially among young children. This is particularly significant as video game graphics develop to become ever more realistic. The effects of violent video games are even worse than those of films and TV because of the interactive element that exists in video games. In addition, most video games are played alone, whereas cinema and television are usually a social experience, allowing social pressures to filter the experience of violence upon the viewer. An Australian Senate Committee established to look at this issue in 1993 concluded 'there is sufficient anecdotal evidence of a linkage…that the community cannot fail to act to control a situation which has the very real potential…to affect young people’1."}

The rights of individual citizens to do as they wish, and play the video games they like most, however violent, is subordinate to the government's right to increase security through the enforcement of restrictions. For example, one accepts the government's right to restrict what we carry onto aircrafts in order to prevent violent attacks. That is not to say there aren't limits to what we can carry on, just as violent video games are still available to adults we can still carry laptops and mobile phones onto aircrafts.

Since differing beliefs about beauty, body types, sexuality, and gender roles exist across societies and cultures, universal definitions of sexist advertising are too difficult to determine. As an example, biological differences exist between women and what may be considered excessively thin in one society may not be so in another. Any type of censoring calls into questions such as who will censor and how will such censorship be applied. The development of standards could favour cultural imperialism. Therefore, sexist advertising is too difficult to codify."}

This legitimacy is enhanced by the anonymity of the internet where deniers can pose as experts and downplay their opponents’ credentials. While the internet is a wonderful tool for spreading knowledge, it can also be subverted to disseminate misinformation. Holocaust deniers have been able to use the internet to a remarkable extent in promoting pseudoscience and pseudo-history that have the surface appearance of credibility. They thus create an echo chamber for their ideas that allows them to spread and to affect people, particularly young people susceptible to such manipulation. By denying these people a platform on the internet, the government is able to not only make a moral stance that is unequivocal, but also to choke off access to new members who can be saved by never seeing the negative messages.

While their visible profile would be diminished, it would not guarantee any positive gains in terms of stamping down on their numbers. Indeed, when they no longer use public channels it will be ever harder for the government to keep track of their doings and of their leaders. The result of this censorship is a more emboldened, harder to detect group that now has a sense of legitimate grievance and victimhood against the state, which it can use to encourage more extreme acts from its members and can spin to its advantage during recruitment efforts. By leaving them in the open they feel more comfortable acting within the confines of the law and are thus far less dangerous, even if they are more visible."}

Rights are general statements of principles that are then caveated and curtailed to fit the public interest across a range of circumstances. When an individual seeks elevation to public office, he or she must accept that the role they are applying for requires extra transparency. As the representative of the people, the politician is more than just the holder of a job appointed by the people, but is the elected servant, whose duty is to lead, including by example. It is a strange relationship, and it is one that demands the utmost confidence in the holder. This political power will often involve power over the public purse so it is essential for the public to know if the candidate is financially honest and not going to use his election for corrupt purposes. This is done generally through political campaigns that focus on candidates’ character and life story. But often candidates prove reticent to share some details, particularly financial details. But if citizens are to make a good decision about what sort of person they wish to lead them, they require information about the financial background of their representatives, to see that they comport themselves in business in a way that is fitting to the character of a leader."}
{"id": 1381, "content": "A lot of politicians come from positions of prestige and power before seeking public office. Many politicians have wealth in their own right, or a base of wealthy supporters. Understanding where that wealth came from and how they used their privileged position is very important to citizens when choosing their leaders. Access to candidates’ financial information allows good candidates to show their honesty and financial uprightness, and sometimes even to display their talent and acumen that allowed them to succeed. More importantly, it allows people to scrutinize the dealings of politicians who used their often privileged position to avoid paying high taxes and to shield their wealth from the public taking its legal due. What these insights provide is a valuable snapshot of what candidates are willing to do to promote their own interests versus those of the state and society. It shows if there is a propensity to engage in morally dubious practices, and such behavior could well be extrapolated to be a potential incentive to corrupt practice. While tax avoidance is not illegal, it can well be considered unjust when rigorously applied, especially considered that the special knowledge necessary to profit from it belongs only to those of wealth and privilege. The value of this knowledge was made particularly clear in the case of Mitt Romney’s presidential bid. When Romney released his tax returns it became painfully clear that he was using the system to his advantage, at the expense of the taxpayer."}

His or her duty is not so special as to demand the handing over of all information on one of the most critical aspects of their private life. Financial affairs like income and taxes are a private matter, and should be treated as such by voters and governments.

In past decades, politicians in many countries were proud to run on the basis of their successes in the private sector. Today, however, that success has often become a liability. One only need look at the paradigmatic example of this occurrence, Mitt Romney. When running for governor in Massachusetts, his strong record in business was touted as a quality favoring him. Yet in the presidential election, Romney’s wealth was touted as an example of capitalist excess, of often ill-gotten gains. These trends would only be compounded with the release of candidates’ financial records. People with records of wealth and financial ability will be further demonized as being anti-poor.

It fuels the growing tendency of the media to attach itself to petty commentary rather than real investigation and analysis. Ultimately, an examination of the personal finances of a candidate tells voters little about what he or she stands for on the issue of state finances. Throughout history, personal financial success has been shown to not necessarily correlate with political acumen.

{"id": 1387, "content": "There are two often-discussed ways to change the rules: require the runner to slide, just as they must do when attempting to reach other bases; or disallow catchers to block runners’ paths. Each results in an imbalance between the catcher and runner. A commentator describes this dynamic very well: “If Major League Baseball was to employ a rule stating that runners must avoid contact with the catcher—similar to the ‘slide or avoid’ rule employed in amateur baseball—it would give the advantage to the catcher. The catcher would have the benefit of dictating the course of action that a baserunner must take, and would—perhaps more importantly—have peace of mind knowing that there is no chance of an ensuing collision. If Major League Baseball was to make a rule stating that the catcher cannot block the plate, the advantage would certainly go to the baserunner, who would enjoy the luxury of a straight path to the most sacred ground on a baseball diamond.” Allowing collisions is the fairest, most even match between the catcher and runner."}

Despite the global economic slowdown, sports revenues worldwide should grow by about 3.7 percent to $145.3 billion by 2015, according to a research report. Moreover, if we were to introduce this coercive measure, there would be numerous disadvantages without significant benefits. It would make no sense to create purposeless tensions between individuals and sporting federations. It is even more absurd considering that competitions and sporting events wouldn't benefit at all.

States derive their rights of control and on the monopoly of violence through what is called the ‘social contract.’ A state gains its right to rule over a population by the people of that state submitting to it their rights to unlimited liberty and the use of force on others in society to the state in return for protection by that state . The individual is sovereign and submits his rights to the state who derives sovereignty from the accumulation of an entire population’s sovereignty. This is where the legitimacy and right to control a population by force comes from. When a state is no longer protecting its people, but rather is systematically removing the security and eroding away the most basic rights and life of those citizens, they no longer are fulfilling the contract and it is void, thus removing their right to sovereignty and immunity from intervention. The necessity of intervention in such a case comes from the desperation of the situation. Regimes that use the machinery of the state and their enriched elite against their populations hold all the wealth, power and military might in the country. There is no hope for self-protection for individuals facing a powerful, organized, and well-funded national army. In such a case, the sovereignty of the individuals need to be protected from the state that abuses them."}

Sanctions target their populations not their personal enrichment they gain through siphoning off money from domestic industry, diplomatic sanctions have no tangible impact on states and peacekeepers are useless when there is no peace to keep. The only true deterrent to regimes around the world is the danger that a strong military rival from outside will intervene and stop them and remove them from power. Sending a strong message that the international community can and will intervene in the cases of human rights abuses seriously increases the costs in regimes' cost-benefit-analysis of state behaviour and deters them from committing human rights abuses for fear of military defeat from abroad."}

The use of any criteria other than merit to select or benefit an individual is the definition of discrimination itself. Simply putting the word “positive” in front of it does not make it a beneficial or just system. For every act of “positive” discrimination enacted, an act of “negative” discrimination occurs against the individual that was denied a position or achievement they earned on their own merit for the person that received the “positive” end of the discrimination. Affirmative action is simply reversing the discrimination in society so injustice is enacted in the opposite direction.

This causes people to resent the minority group for getting for “free” what people feel they had to work hard for. This furthers the perception of the minority as being inferior, and removes their capacity to be treated as an equal in the workplace and prove themselves. This assumption is not only harmful to those minorities who did receive assistance from affirmative action, but also anyone of that minority group regardless of if they were hired using affirmative action because there is simply an assumption that they are less qualified and there because of the policy because the policy exists. Therefore, affirmative action creates an assumption that minorities in the workplace are less qualified and inherently inferior to the other workers due to the affirmative action policy causing resentment and deepening inequality, not helping eradicate it."}

The large number of police on the ground also allows for a supervisory role in the community after the prisoner is released to reduce re-offending.

This may push men to be more dominating than otherwise and women to suffer from anorexia, low self-esteem, and promiscuity. We can expect women to be the most affected by this, simply because the porn industry is owned almost entirely by men, and because there are pre-existing patriarchal structures in society ready to promote the idea that women are there to serve men.

Examples such as amateur and improvised porn, which are independent of a director, show the deep value of self-expression and self-definition women can find in this form of art. The desire of some actresses to become internationally recognised as ‘sex symbols’, become porn stars, or simply convey that sex is for women too, is a legitimate one, and not an act of desperation.

It would be difficult to monitor which staff are bringing guns into school without a lot of investment in searches and detectors – money that could have paid for professional security. It is thus arguable that the proposition’s mechanism does not stand."}

As a result it is necessary to widen the applicant pool in order to be able to ensure there are more candidates for the army. Allowing women to serve in combat effectively doubles the possible talent pool available for the military to recruit for delicate and sensitive jobs which require interpersonal skills that not every soldier possesses. The result will be better and more diplomatic soldiers who will be particularly useful in L.I.C.s."}

Not allowing combat roles for women has an unfortunate side effect of increasing inequality in terms of ranks. Combat duty is necessary or highly beneficial for promotion to senior officer positions in many armies. Women have to be given the same opportunities as men, in the army in order to have the same opportunities they have to be exposed to the same risks.

{"id": 1423, "content": "If militaries use gender-blind recruitment and training, women will suffer a high rate of injury as a result of physical differences. The standards of physical fitness have been set to suit men, and women attempting to reach them will over-stretch themselves. For example, when the U.K. military began using gender-blind training in the 1990s, the rate of medical discharge of female recruits jumped from 4.6% to 11.1%. Women serving in integrated units will suffer higher injury rates as a result of this. For example, armies march according to the male stride length of 45 cm, rather than the shorter female stride length of 38 cm. Women marching at the male pace are therefore at increased risk of stress fractures in pubic bones."}

This ethnic cleansing often leads to systematic rape of women and mass murder of men. For example, in the Bosnian Wars of the early 1990s, systematic rape was carried out against all ethnic groups, but particular by ethnic Serbs against Bosnian Muslims. While it is unlikely that anything will happen to peacekeeping units if one side does turn on the peacekeepers it is likely that female soldiers will be treated the same as women from the enemy side if the rape mentality has been set in the minds of the soldiers."}
{"id": 1425, "content": "Even if marriages are not made absolutely mandatory, covert family pressure can still propel people into unions where they will be unhappy. This is a form of restricted liberty as the consequences of people rebelling against arranged marriages can include being forced to leave home or suffering stigmatisation and reduced contact with family members. The stigma may also be the other way with the family feeling shame when their children reject their arrangements this in turn can lead to attempts at compulsion and even some cases like that of Shafilea Ahmed murder for the rejection of the marriage. Although things like stigmatisation are harder to police than physical intimidation or violence, it is only right that the state steps in to regulate these harms, giving people the legal mandate to challenge the practice as well as to discourage relatives from attempting it from the outset."}
{"id": 1426, "content": "There is simply no feasible way of enforcing laws against arranged marriages, particularly as it is almost guaranteed that many communities will continue to practice them regardless. It will be impossible to tell whether a marriage has been started by arrangement if the community and the couple are unwilling to go to the police and most will be unwilling to report their own families when practicing a cultural tradition. Those who are deeply dissatisfied and beaten may do so but in this instance the law already allows divorce and abuse is punishable by the full force of the law. Given that forced marriages have already been outlawed and that it has been established that arranged marriages in themselves cause few provable harms, the resources of any police force would arguably be wasted on enforcing such a law; investigations would be very intrusive and labour intensive. Furthermore, given the continuation of practices like honour killings,  as well as rape and domestic violence, law enforcement personnel would be better placed targeting far more heinous crimes than arranged marriages. A tangible harm could arise from the police being made to direct their energies towards such minor misdemeanours, in that there could be fewer resources available for more serious crimes."}

In the slums of Manila that research is unnecessary as it is all too apparent at a glance. However the research is there  to provide grisly commentary to the narrative folding out on the streets. Investigations on a personal, national and global level demonstrate that effective family planning is at the heart of eradicating poverty . When families have less children they are more able to afford better education for those they do have and have a greater incentive to do so as they need their child to be able to support them when they are retired."}

{"id": 1430, "content": "Reproductive cloning harms the integrity of the family. Single people will be able to produce offspring without even the physical presence of a partner. Once born, the child will be denied the love of one parent, most probably the father.

This sign of love is lost when a child’s life begins in a laboratory."}

{"id": 1432, "content": "Cloning treats children as objects. Children will be manufactured by an expensive technological process that is subject to quality control. The gulf between an artisan and an artefact is immense. Individuals will be able to have a child for the sake of having children, or as a symbol of status, rather than because they desire to conceive, love and raise another human being. Cloning will not only allow, but actually encourage, the commodification of people."}
{"id": 1433, "content": "Cloning is unlikely to be widespread so any dangers from any reduction in the diversity of the human gene pool will be so limited as to be virtually non-existent. The expense and time necessary for successful human cloning should mean that it will only be used to the benefit of the small minority of people who require the technology. The pleasure of procreation through sexual intercourse does not suggest that whole populations will prefer to reproduce asexually through cloning. The only significant lack of diversity which can be expected will be in women who suffer from a severe mitochondrial disease. They will be able to use cloning by nuclear transfer in order to avoid passing on the disease which is carried in their egg cells to any offspring. This elimination of harmful genetic traits from the gene pool is no different from the eradication of infectious disease, such as small pox, and should be welcomed. So against these very marginal worries there is potentially great good to be done through cloning. Currently already we have IVF and genetic screening which can prevent that babies with certain diseases are born. In 2000 the baby Adam Nash was born, genetically manipulated through IVF, as a genetic fit to cure his sister Molly from Fanconi anemia. It could be a way of curing siblings from chronic diseases and also ensuring that the transplants (for example) will not be rejected due to genetic differences."}

The longing for a child genetically related to oneself existed long before biotechnology, but it is only recently that medicine has been able to satisfy it.

{"id": 1436, "content": "Criminalizing the acts of selling and buying sexual services does not protect those who sell or buy such services, but rather pushes these activities underground. While market exchanges of sexual services involve some risk-taking, the risks are increased and compounded when such markets are prohibited. When selling and buying sex is illegal, those participating in these exchanges cannot, or simply do not, seek the protection of the law when their rights are violated. Because crimes against sex workers or their clients are often unreported, and when reported often not investigated, predators and rights violators can take advantage of others without fear of arrest and punishment. Moreover, because criminalization forces sex work into remote and invisible corners of society, sellers and buyers are less able to insure their safety and protection. For these reasons, laws criminalizing sex markets amplify the risks sellers and buyers face when they participate in sex market transactions. The main purpose of criminalizing sex markets is to protect those who enter such markets from harm. Yet the harms of paying or accepting money for a good that can be legally exchanged for free are far less than the harms that result from the rights violations that often occur (robbery, battery, sexual assault, murder) when sex markets are pushed underground."}
{"id": 1437, "content": "While many societies have attempted to restrict sex to marriage, few (if any) have succeeded. In contemporary, secular liberal societies, adults are no longer punished for pursuing sex outside of marriage. Many adults find non-marital sex satisfying, healthy, and fulfilling, whether it occurs in the context of an ongoing romantic relationship, a casual friendship, or a market exchange. While many people will never seek the services of a sex worker, those who do are often seeking sensual comfort, companionship, entertainment, and fantasy fulfilment. While the latter goods are often obtainable in non-market relationships, some people prefer the convenience and efficiency of market mechanisms for securing these goods. In a liberal society, individuals are free to pursue their own vision of happiness, as long as they respect the moral and civil rights of others. Markets that provide sexual services enable some individuals to secure goods essential to their happiness. Those who provide services to these individuals can do so in a manner that respects their rights and dignity, if the markets are legal and well regulated."}
{"id": 1438, "content": "Sexual autonomy means being able to control when, where, and with whom one has sexual relations. It also means that, at any moment, one may withdraw from a sexual relationship or encounter. Spouses, lovers, and also strangers have the right to sexual autonomy. If an adult chooses to engage in sex with other adults who offer material benefits, her right to sexual autonomy is respected as long as she has control over when, where, and with which clients she has sexual relations, and as long as she is mentally competent and is allowed to terminate the agreement at any time. If markets in sex were to become legal, the rights of providers (and clients) to sexual autonomy would need to be respected. This means that sex workers would maintain the right to refuse service to any customer, and to discontinue service or employment at any time and for any reason. Like other workers, sexual service providers would have the right to a safe and healthy work place. Workers who are drug dependent, or otherwise incompetent or highly vulnerable in the work place, would need to be provided treatment and time off work until they were capable of protecting themselves and others."}
{"id": 1439, "content": "Some markets in sex should be blocked. Markets that involve child labor, forced labor or sex, and forced migration and detention, should be stopped and those who organize and profit from such markets should be prosecuted. As with any service, it is critically important that no one is forced to work or to continue working, either through the threat of harm or through fraud and deception. It is also critically important that children are protected from sexual predators, and are excluded from all aspects of sex businesses. Forced labor and child sexual abuse involve violations of basic human rights that all societies are expected to protect. Voluntary, adult sex work is significantly different from trafficking, and law enforcers need to distinguish market exchanges involving consensual sex among adults from market exchanges involving forced sex among adults or involving minors. By legalizing voluntary, adult sex work, law enforcers and rights protectors could focus their efforts on eliminating markets that involve the sexual abuse of adults or children. Additionally, clients of sex business would have the choice of patronizing legal business, and therefore would be less likely to patronize inadvertently a business that relies on forced or child labor."}
{"id": 1440, "content": "Sexual relationships involve crossing ordinary social boundaries that exist between people, and exposing aspects of ourselves that normally remain private. This aspect of sexual relationships renders the parties vulnerable emotionally and socially, and therefore sexual partners often extract commitments from each other of sexual fidelity and exclusivity. These commitments allow people to engage in sexual relationships while treating each other with decency and respect. Markets are public and involve exchanges among strangers. In markets, goods are exchanged with the highest bidders and not with those to whom we are committed and loyal. For this reason, markets in sex undermine the ideals of sexual commitment, loyalty, or exclusivity, which makes decent and respectful sexual relationships possible. Markets are for exchanging shoes and cars, or services that we can separate from ourselves without leaving us emotionally and socially vulnerable or exposed. Sexual relationships require commitments of fidelity and exclusivity so we don’t lose part of ourselves in the exchange."}
{"id": 1441, "content": "Markets in sex are shaped by values that differ from non-market sexual relationships. Market sexual transactions are not structured by the ideals of fidelity and exclusivity between social intimates, but rather by the ends of profit maximization and mutual benefit among strangers. The goods exchanged in a market are interchangeable with other goods, in ways that maximize profit and mutual benefit. When these goods include sexual services, the sexual services of one provider will be interchangeable with those of another. The position of seller or buyer in a particular market is often determined by one’s gender, class, race, and nationality. In sex markets, sellers are typically female, and buyers are typically male. Race, class, and other social hierarchies also shape one’s position in a sex market. Because the sellers in sex markets are often people who are disadvantaged by their gender, class, race, or nationality, the existence of markets in their sexual services will promote the idea that the sexual capacities of women (and other disadvantaged groups) are goods that are interchangeable and exploitable. The idea that the sexual capacities of women (and girls) can be accessed as market goods or commodities will shape attitudes toward women and girls who do not enter sex markets as providers. In this way, the values that structure markets in sex will spill over into non-market sexual relationships, and lead men to regard women as replaceable goods rather than unique human subjects."}

The ASBO is the latest example of excessive state interference in the lives of citizens. Either conduct is criminal, or it is not. The law of nuisance exists. ASBOs aren’t intended to deal with that kind of problem: they’re the tool of the state controlling behaviour. Just because a problem exists, doesn’t mean it’s the job of the state to try and fix it.

Unfortunately, he went out before reading the Order and beached it twice that day. The next day he went out again and breached it three times by mistake as he had not read the part covering the particular restriction. He now faces possibly custody although he has never been convicted of a criminal offence.” The issuing of ASBOs is inconsistent and almost amounts to a geographical lottery.

There is clear prejudice in the job market, as shown in a study by Marianne Bertrand, an associate professor at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, and Sendhil Mullainathan of Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A senior academic will look to see in applicants qualities they see in themselves, so, given the overwhelmingly white, affluent, male makeup of the academic community, minorities are at a disadvantage even if the admissions officer is not intending to discriminate against them. Prejudice towards certain types of applicants is blatantly unfair, and also undermines meritocracy (as explained above).

This policy merely papers over the cracks by masking the fact that the failures of state-funded schooling and attempts at integration have led to a situation in which ethnic minorities and the poor are so vastly underrepresented in universities. The state should do more to address these underlying problems, rather than covering up its failures with a tokenistic policy. Better funding of state schools, real parental choice in education, and accountability through the publication of comparable examination data would all drive up standards and allow more underprivileged children to fulfil their potential."}
{"id": 1454, "content": "The issues underlying all debates on child soldiers go to the very heart of intercultural justice, politics and governance. International and supranational legislation notwithstanding, the notion that children should be protected from all forms of violence at any cost is expressly western. The facts stated in the introduction are not sufficient to support the creation of a defence of cultural relativism to charges of recruiting and using child soldiers. They are also methods of living, of survival and of ordering societies that change and develop in response to societies’ environments. Within many communities, children are inducted (or induct themselves) into military organisations as a result of necessity. The traditional providers of physical safety within a society may have been killed or displaced by war. Communities left vulnerable by long running and vaguely defined conflicts may have no other option but to begin arming their children, in order to help them avoid violent exploitation. A great many child soldiers in South Sudan actively sought out units of the rebel army known to accept child recruits . Following the death of parents and the dispersal of extended families, children gravitated towards known sources of safety and strength – organisations capable of providing protection and independence within nations utterly distorted and ruined by conflict. Western notions of inviolate childhood, free of worry and violence, are merely a cultural construct. This construct cannot be duplicated in societies beset by forms of privation and conflict that have been alien to western liberal democracies for the last seventy years. Attempting to enforce this construct as law- and as a form of law that can trump domestic legislation- endangers vulnerable communities, inhibits the creation of democratic norms and can even criminalise the children it claims to protect."}

Human rights also include fair treatment under the welfare state, and increased economic protections for migrants is necessary in many states for them to receive such treatment. Without this equal treatment, common myths about migrants will continue to be widely believed. These myths claim that immigrants are criminals and that they steal jobs from natives. The organization Migrant Rights says, “All these myths rob migrant workers and refugees of their humanity, and are aimed at portraying them as less deserving of our sympathy and help.” It is a violation of migrants’ human rights to be treated this way, and they will only be seen as equals when they are granted economic protection that allows them to work alongside natives."}

If we really want to help lift people out of poverty for good, we should give to charities which focus on these bigger development issues - for example Christian Aid believes that “it is better to help whole communities through our partner organisations rather than sponsor individuals\" . We should also join campaigns to make rich world governments do more to help the developing world by increasing spending on aid , forgiving debt, and making the global trade rules fairer for developing countries."}

Parents also have to share their child’s problems, fears and traumas, so that the amount of grief that parents take on themselves doubles (or even triples, depending on how troublesome the child is). Not only that, but those who have offspring also become more vulnerable. They worry about their kids from the moment they are born until the day they themselves die. Parents’ to-worry-about list is endless: from child’s nutrition to summer camps, from accidents to social acceptance, from choosing a school to moving out. Having raised children, parents become emotional wrecks."}

{"id": 1471, "content": "The most basic purpose of every human being, like of any other animal, is to reproduce, thus ensuring the continuity of ones species. Reproduction is even included in our very definition of life “the state or quality that distinguishes living beings or organisms from dead ones and from inorganic matter, characterized chiefly by metabolism, growth, and the ability to reproduce and respond to stimuli”. It is only by having children that we can fulfil the most natural goal of our existence. Until very recently the family and ensuring its continuance has been the goal of almost every human. This is shown by how hereditary has been one of the defining features of almost every society in history, whether it is in government; through monarchy or an aristocracy, in the economy; through passing wealth down from one generation to the next."}
{"id": 1472, "content": "Not only does parenting teach responsibility, but it also triggers such feelings as love, compassion and helps develop such features as patience, devotion, tenderness, understanding. For instance, if parents learn the benefits of being patient towards their children, they are more likely to react patiently in other life situations, which in turn will lead to less aggressive society. Therefore, the more people have children, the more desirable our society becomes."}

That in this case the labor is on services does not make any difference, the product of the housewife’s labor is that the children are looked after and domestic matters are all sorted. This is beneficial to society as housewives in addition to helping their own family are likely to have the time to help out others – through volunteering, through looking after other’s children after school etc. It is estimated that the value of a housemaker’s services would be equivalent to approximately £30,000 per year . In the same way that any product or service is created, offered or manufactured by individual workers, the services of home-keeping are delivered by the labor of the home-keeper. Just as all workers are entitled to remuneration for the goods and services they create, so is a housewife is so entitled for the house-keeping services they offer. Daily Mail  19 Feb 2008, Print."}

The stereotype is particularly damaging to women’s expectations for themselves and the way society treats women. By paying housewives for their work, a greater emphasis is placed on the role of the home-keeper and on the women that tend to this job. It elevates the position of women in the household by economically empowering them and giving them the very thing that usually implies the greater importance of the bread-winners in the family (economic power and status). Moreover, it elevates societal views of housewives and home-keepers by valuing their contributions to the household and society in a tangible, monetary way that society cares about. Paying housewives for their work grants greater social status and power to women and family lives, which improves views of women and the roles they take in the family."}

{"id": 1476, "content": "The economic sphere and the private (family) sphere have separate obligations and systems of contracts. The way in which the economic system works is that generally people are paid for their labor by those who benefit from it, either directly or indirectly. This is a mutual relationship of monetary-labor exchange. In the family sphere, the contracts are based on personal obligation and the family unit as opposed to individual contraction of services. The family unit is a pre-existing relationship not created on labor-pay agreements. Individuals opt into being a parent in a family unit on a voluntary basis and with no expectation or pretence of return for their services, except perhaps from their children in the future. Remuneration is created in the form of a functioning, rewarding family unit and family life and the products and services produced are of no quantifiable monetary value nor can they be sold or do they create wealth. Because housewives do not labor for anybody outside of their household, they should not be paid by anybody outside of their family. Moreover most of the work that housewives do would have to be done by a member of the family unit regardless of whether everyone was also engaged in monetized work – there would still need to be washing, cleaning, shopping etc done. Housewives do not exist as workers in the economic sphere as they do not create a monetized product with their labor and opt into the agreement on voluntary non-monetary bases. As such, they are not entitled to pay."}
{"id": 1477, "content": "On a very practical level, this policy could never be implemented. As much as housewives are valuable members of society, it is economically impossible to pay them wages. It is only possible to increase somebody’s pay if that person creates increased wealth. There is no direct increase in wealth creation caused by housewives and therefore it would be impossible to gain a direct or accurate valuation or mechanism of exchange for housewife pay. Even if there was no market mechanism needed, and assuming that there is no interest in getting an accurate valuation of housewife economic contribution, there is no way for a government to finance this. Without the creation of a product or service that has a consumer who would be able to use the money to purchase such services, there is no method of capital accumulation to reimburse the home-keeper with. The baby or child who is receiving the service does not have the ability to pay. Should the government attempt to fill this void, it would be prohibitively expensive to create wages for every single housewife in a country."}
{"id": 1478, "content": "Fairness requires that cohabiting couples share their property on separation: when couples have lived together for a long period (such as five years or more) they will have gained benefits at each other’s expense but also suffered disadvantages for the other’s benefit. If one partner gives up a career to raise children or support the other in their career, they are seriously disadvantaged upon separation. Where the other partner has gained as a result of this sacrifice, they should compensate the former, so that the two parties can move towards independence in equal positions. Parties may choose not to marry, but this should not have to cause such financial harm to one partner."}
{"id": 1479, "content": "Property rights for unmarried couples undermine marriage as an institution, harming society. The societal shift away from marriage is harmful. Marriages tend to be more stable than cohabitation because of the greater level of commitment involved: the mutual support of a marriage is beneficial for individuals and can create a more secure environment for raising children. Because of the higher exit costs (divorce is difficult and time-consuming), married couples are more likely to resolve their problems than cohabiting couples who can walk away more easily. Giving legal rights to cohabiting couples endorses more diverse relationships, suggesting that marriage is less important. This is harmful as it is likely in the long term to further reduce the number of marriages, leading to fewer stable relationships."}
{"id": 1480, "content": "When couples choose not to get married, perhaps because one party is not willing to do so, this does not indicate the same commitment to each other. Where there are considerable disparities in income or wealth couples may have no desire to divide their assets and the choice not to get married may reflect this. Those who desire financial protection can choose to marry but the state should not intervene when couples do not make this choice, beyond ensuring that provision is made for children. Such intervention undermines the autonomy of individuals within cohabiting couples because it suggests that they cannot make these decisions competently for themselves."}
{"id": 1481, "content": "The status quo discourages care for children and the elderly: a further consequence of the perceived need for independence is that individuals are less able to reduce their working hours in order to care for young children or elderly relatives, in case they suffer significantly as a result, for example if their relationship ends. Children who see more of their parents often develop stronger relationships with their parents which are valuable in later life when they need advice or support. In addition, studies show that it is beneficial for their emotional development. Elderly people, on the other hand, often feel particularly vulnerable and isolated and care from relatives plays an important role in maintaining their inclusion within society."}
{"id": 1482, "content": "Hate crime enhancements are unjust because they respond to two equal results (i.e. assault vs. racial mugging) with different punishments. We need to judge solely on the concrete actions of the aggressor in order to prevent punishments from being based on arbitrary judgements as to an offender’s “intent”, which can be very difficult to prove. Otherwise “intent” may be supposed or argued in cases where it did not exist, leading to perverse sentencing whereby a crime is punished more harshly despite the true absence of intent. There is a danger of unjustly branding someone as bigoted and punishing them excessively, e.g. for their involvement in a bar fight where the victim coincidentally belonged to a minority group. Juries might also be willing to make the logical leap that, because the aggressor was proved to hold bigoted views in general towards his victim's ethnic group, these views must have motivated his actions in this individual incident, despite the absence of any evidence linking the specific brawl in a bar to the aggressor's views. Therefore it is unjust to punish two crimes with equal effects differently on the highly subjective basis of “intent”, and thus hate crime enhancements are unjust."}
{"id": 1483, "content": "Hate crimes are crimes that are based on an idea that the perpetrator had prior to the crime. The crime itself is no different from any other crime except that it is punished more harshly. Because we are punishing an idea. All forms of violent crime, whether they are murders, rapes, or beatings are an expression of hatred toward another human being. To add more punishment to a crime because it represents a particular kind of hate (an idea) is to unfairly distinguish between different violent acts and trivialize those violent acts that do not appear to be motivated by prejudice hate. This is unjust because the idea itself does not cause harm, and is in fact legal in most cases (with the exception of direct incitement to violence), as racist or prejudiced statements and ideas are not illegal in most western liberal democracies. We allow extreme and prejudiced ideas to be legal because we recognise the value of free speech and open discourse in debating and discussing ideas, so as to best allow for progress in human thought. Hate crime enhancements constitute an attack on this as they make an individual liable for harsher punishments for his actions if he holds certain views, and thus the law unfairly discriminates against these particular viewpoints and not against others, and so hate crime enhancements are unjust."}
{"id": 1484, "content": "Hate crimes should be given a more severe penalty because the harm done to the victim and society is greater. Given that the intent of hate crimes is more malicious than simple premeditative murder; it is just to enhance hate crime laws to reflect stronger punishment. Hate crimes don't merely victimize the individual upon whom violence is inflicted, they also victimize a community or minority group that the hate crime was intended to terrorize. This is why hate crimes frequently include highly public acts such as lynchings in town squares, dragging hate crime victims behind cars along streets inhabited by certain communities, and graffiti on significant buildings -they are intended to send a message. Hate crime-delivered messages limit the freedom of expression and group association of the victim community, thus violating their liberties. For this reason, hate crimes have more victims than other crimes, and subsequently deserver greater punishment. Moreover, as hate crimes are generally perpetrated against minority groups, and because these minority groups are always in a state of social disenfranchisement; it could be argued that hate crime enhancements are the state's way of attempting to arbitrate equality to minorities by compensating them with laws that will better favour their interests, thus forcibly \"balancing the scale\" of social equity."}
{"id": 1485, "content": "The additional punishment given to hate crimes under enhancements can help deter people who hold hateful views from acting on them, as they fear going to prison for any amount of time, and so any additional punishment affects their risk calculation before they commit a hate crime. Moreover, increased punishments help prevent those who have perpetrated hate crimes from re-offending through rehabilitation in prison. In cases of crimes motivated by deep hatred, rehabilitation may require increased time and increased effort in order to provide criminals with the correct focus and concentration, and a longer sentence is necessary for this to happen. Hate is not an essential human trait, we are not born hating people, it is a learned factor that can be unlearned when correctly rehabilitated. Therefore hate crime enhancements are just because they help prevent hate crimes and help prevent hate crime recidivism."}
{"id": 1486, "content": "The freedom of sexual expression (and exploration) is not only a matter of choice which is fundamental to the individual – it is also particularly important to young people as they proceed through the stage of adolescence into young adulthood. Age of consent laws place artificial limits on this freedom. Sex is entirely natural and should be celebrated in the context of loving relationships, not criminalised and put under the prying eye of an authoritarian state. Violence, coercion and exploitation in sexual relationships should still be punished, but not consensual activity. Such restrictions go against the human rights to privacy and of freedom of expression. The concept that young people do not know what they are doing is flawed, because every person who has gone through sexual development has learnt by doing. There is no process of suddenly coming into full knowledge without acting and exploration. Such exploration would be more safely done in an environment that doesn't criminalize it. Such criminalization can actaully lead to the very harm that the law ostensibly seeks to avoid, coercion and exploitation, for it is people who are naturally more inclined to coercion and exploitation that will disregard the law anyway. This feeds the lambs to the wolves."}
{"id": 1487, "content": "Some countries have one age of consent for young females (say 16) and a different, higher age of consent for young males or for having anal sex (say 18).

Age of consent laws, if we are to have them at all, should be equalised across the genders."}

Both parties then become real victims as they are put at greater risk of contracting STDs or unwanted pregnancies."}
{"id": 1489, "content": "It is undeniable that young children form a special and vulnerable group in society. Nowhere is this truer than in the context of sex – so much so that we often need to protect them by placing limitations on what they do sexually. Below a certain minimum age, children are at risk of not having the physiological, biological and, most importantly, emotional development to cope with sex, and with the many possible consequences of having sex, which include teen pregnancy, illegal or legal abortion, childbirth, parental and societal disapproval, unsupported parenthood, legal consequences and increased risk of cervical cancer. That does not mean that choosing an average, approximate age for consensual sex, such as 16, is arbitrary or wrong. There is no great harm in asking “early developers” to wait for a year or two before they begin to have sex. Especially young people are not always as mature as they believe they are."}

The problem of paedophilia is already a rapidly growing one, made worse by its expansion into ‘related’ avenues such as child pornography. In addition to the obvious problem of paedophilia, the problem of the sexual predation of young children also encompasses the problem of youth prostitution (since prostitution is itself already legal in many countries), and the international traffic in boys and girls."}

{"id": 1492, "content": "Partial-birth abortions form a tiny proportion of all abortions, but from a medical and psychological point of view they ought to be the least controversial. The reason for this focus is that late-term abortions are the most obviously distasteful, because late-term foetuses look more like babies than embryos or foetuses at an earlier developmental stage. Late-term abortions therefore make for the best pro-life campaigning material. By attempting to focus the debate here, campaigners are aiming to conflate all abortions with late-term abortions, and to increase opposition to all abortion on that basis."}

Finally as those who are having late partial birth abortions are likely to be suicidal, or at least will be very determined to get rid of their child they are the most likely to resort to back-street methods that cause damage to themselves."}

Individuals who pay in cash for a one way flight while carrying no luggage, as Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab  did, are a fairly small group and it makes sense to target them. Profiling is a great deal more subtle than a decision to target a single ethnic group. It is entirely possible to identify patterns in the behaviour of terrorists, drug mules and smugglers, and to respond to that accordingly. Obviously, the more refined the profile can be, the better. It is incredibly unlikely that an affluent, Caucasian businessman with a return ticket for the following day is either a suicide bomber or a drug smuggler.

Until women hold higher positions in these fields the feminist cause has still not achieved its goals- in seeking to create a world where, amongst other things women can advance up the ladder in their career without being blocked by a glass ceiling and held back in lower positions."}
{"id": 1500, "content": "Employers worry when they hire young/middle aged women. They fear that after hiring a woman, she will only cost the company money by getting pregnant and going on maternity leave. To combat this attitude, maternity and paternity leave should be equal. Currently, paternity leave is a maximum of two consecutive weeks. These two weeks must be taken within 56 days of the child’s birth. This can be contrasted with the long maternity leave that is allowed for. Women are entitled to 52 weeks of maternity leave from day one of employment. Women are entitled to maternity pay for 39 weeks if they have been working for their employer for 26 weeks. Father’s also do not have the right to take time off work to attend antenatal classes, this allowance is for pregnant employees only. The feminist cause still has this issue to resolve. Until paternity leave is offered an employer can safely assume that a woman will be the partner to burden the care of the child and the employer will be the one to bear these costs of maternity leave. This gives men an unfair advantage in the workplace as they are a “safer bet” for employment."}
{"id": 1501, "content": "By focusing on women and their problems, feminism fails to recognise that there are inequality issues in which men are the victims. For example: boys are falling behind girls in academic achievement; far less money is spent on combating ‘male’ than ‘female’ diseases (the difference between the amount of research into breast cancer and prostate cancer is a striking.) Last year, an oven cleaner ad drew a thousand-plus complaints for the slogan, “So easy, even a man can use it.” These can only be tackled by recognising that feminism has gone too far. The battle for equality is no longer needed but rather, we must remember feminism was never a tool for women to get their own back."}
{"id": 1502, "content": "Many women no longer identify themselves as feminists, associating feminism with man-hating, sex-hating humourlessness, and seeing it as a relic of the 1970s.

Some women would question where the line between feminism and positive sexism begins. Women no longer want to associate themselves with a cause that is outdated and outmoded."}
{"id": 1503, "content": "There is certainly a case to be made that women, in modern-western society have completely shattered the traditional values and roles that are best suited to them. For example, it has always been the case that men have been the providers, the defenders of themselves, the household and the family. Women have been the maintainers of these things. These things are not unfair. They are simply what each gender is best suited for. Women should not feel lesser than men simply because they are \"supposed\" to do \"motherly things\". The feminist movement has gone beyond its cause in beginning to deem what role in life is more appropriate."}
{"id": 1504, "content": "Surely providing a financial incentive for families to produce women causes women to be likened to a product that needs to be manufactured. Families will continue to have a social stigma against female children and they will be viewed simply as a financial asset. This is not only bad for women in general in the country but for babies that are only alive because they provide income. These children are unlikely to be loved and cared for as a male child might be and it is cruel to encourage them to be brought into the world to live life in such a condition. Furthermore, the commoditisation of money can only serve to worsen the problem of trafficking mentioned earlier by the proposition."}
{"id": 1505, "content": "Seen from a philosophical point is that if a child is not brought into the world, it has not benefited of the community and in that sense you can never harm a person by bring it into existence, unless the person's life is so dreadful that nonexistence is preferable. That life with a disability or chronic illness is predictably worse than non-existence is not plausible for most of the defects for which we test, even Down syndrome, which is the most tested for and common reason for abortion, Where in fact a happy disposition is actually a characteristic trait. Hence, bringing a child into existence cannot count as harming it."}
{"id": 1506, "content": "Hate speech poses a clear danger to students and other members of the campus community. Often, the hatred is directed towards minority groups that are easily identifiable based on skin colour, clothing, or behaviour. Because these minorities are easy to identify, they can be targeted by those swayed by the speaker’s message. Every hate crime is a tragedy and an attack against the principles of WLDs. Even when the message doesn’t provoke violence, it can have a deep emotional harm on members of the targeted community. As such, the government has a duty to intervene to ensure that individuals are safe."}
{"id": 1507, "content": "While hate speech is a form of expression, it is not one that encourages dialogue. By promoting hatred based on immutable personal characteristics it is by definition anti-dialogue. Hate speech does not contribute anything; it merely provides a justification for violence and discrimination. Extreme messages, be they in words or through symbols, deter moderates from voicing their opinions, either because they do not want to legitimize the message or out of fear of reprisals. This reduces the net dialogue on university campuses and injures the quality of the dialogue that remains."}
{"id": 1508, "content": "When individuals feel that they will be targeted at a university based on who they are, they are less likely to attend that university either out of fear they will be discriminated against or because they believe that they will not be allowed to express themselves freely without being discriminated against or assaulted. No group should be discouraged from attaining higher education because of immutable personal characteristics. Tertiary education is at the heart of social mobility and self-actualization. Even if no attack ever takes place, because hate speech can create an atmosphere which deters members of society from attending university the state is justified in banning it."}
{"id": 1509, "content": "The truth can only emerge from competition between various ideas in free, transparent discourse. To silence any idea is to remove ideas from the marketplace thus reducing the individual’s ability to use his/her reason and intellect to arrive at a conclusion. When this happens, it becomes more likely that individuals who feel alienated from main stream society will find meaning in the hateful ideas which have also been excluded from the mainstream. This is very similar to the concept of the free market in economics where the freer the market the better off everyone is."}
{"id": 1510, "content": "Historically, universities have been centres of free speech and expression. The idea of tenure for professors was developed to ensure academic freedom both for teachers and students. As Oliver Wendell Holmes commented, \"The very aim and end of our institutions is just this: that we may think what we like and say what we think.\" Free speech on campus is responsible for producing, or at least fostering many of the progressive ideas of the 20th century even though these ideas were threatening and caused emotion distress to many people."}
{"id": 1511, "content": "Students need to be able to take chances and express unpopular ideas in order to maximize their personal growth and development. Speech codes, even ones designed to only censor hate speech, have a chilling effect on all speech as students become afraid to say anything that is not politically correct. For example a student at California Polytechnic State University underwent a day long disciplinary hearing for posting a flyer publicising a talk “It’s O.K. to Leave the Plantation”. Students also need to learn to respond to ideas they don’t like because even if censorship of hate speech is effectively controlled on campus, it still exists in the outside world. Students will only be able to maximize their ability to ask questions, state opinions, and respond to ideas on a free campus."}

As it is not an essential procedure, the state should not be expected to subsidize either the process or the development of the technology.

And I don't think doctors have any business being there' 1.Furthermore, In the view of many, the new technologies are not morally different from abortion - in all cases a potential life is taken.

They are not driven by profit and offer information on their discoveries for free enabling others to build upon their findings.

It is purely in the pursuit of their profits that they decide not to allow others to build on their findings and make the process of discovering treatments far more difficult.

{"id": 1517, "content": "Numerous studies have shown that children do best when they are raised by two married, biological parents1. In the case of adopted children that is impossible, but a man and a woman is the best approximation of that family. Since that is the best environment to raise children, the government has to encourage and promote these traditional unions, not undermine them. Allowing gay couples to legally become parents, would legally and socially redefine what a family is and society as a whole may suffer. Children who are adopted already face bullying and exclusion in school because of their difference, placing them in same-sex households will double their exclusion and make their lives much harder than if placed in an opposite-sex household."}
{"id": 1518, "content": "The focus of this debate should not be on gay rights, but on what is in the best interest of the adopted child. The adoption process' goal is to find the most suitable parents for that child, not to resolve other social inequalities and injustices. Being raised in a traditional family, by a mother and father, is the best environment for a child. Studies have shown that children who are raised by homosexual couples can have problems with substance abuse, violence and 'at risk' behaviour. Therefore the state has the obligation to try to provide the child with that environment."}

It is difficult to give an accurate number on the cost of illegal immigrants for the rest of the population (the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) has come up with numbers as high as $1,183 per household in the state of California1), but they are likely to put a strain on resources by not paying taxes whilst demanding social services such as healthcare and education. As a result, they take taxpayer's money away from those who are lawfully entitled to use these services and put a burden on the state. Moreover, illegal immigrants undercut the labour market by accepting low wages and working under illegal conditions. This is harmful to lawful residents because it takes employment opportunities away from them and encourages employers to seek illegal labour in order to keep costs down. Removing the illegal workforce would increase the number of jobs available to lawful residents and force employers to pay fair wages and provide safe working conditions."}
{"id": 1520, "content": "The repatriation of illegal immigrants, even if it is not completely under coercion, is immoral. Even if the repatriation is 'voluntary', immigrants know they have no alternatives, and might agree to go back voluntary because the next step would be involuntary repatriation. This means that illegal immigrants are severely restricted in their freedom of movement. In the Western world, people can move around relatively easily, and this is seen as an inalienable right. To restrict this for people that do not come from this part of the world would be inhumane. Moreover, illegal immigrants have often built their lives in the country they reside in, having a family, sometimes children, work and a social circle. Often, children from illegal immigrants get citizenship because of their age, whilst their parents are repatriated. This forceful separation of children from their parents is a violation of their human rights, as article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that the family is the natural unit in society which is entitled to state protection1. Separating children from their mother can be seen as a violation of this right."}

All of this is positive for the economies of Gabon and Equatorial Guinea.

This provides a platform for a focus on broad based development across the entire nation, rather than one-sideded development focused on one city. In Gabon’s case there was both construction of the Stade de l’Amitié-Sino-Gabonaise in the Capital and a rebuild of a stadium in Franceville for €76.2 million ."}

At present only a tiny handful of the best native players will get a chance to play for top clubs due to their profit and success motives. This means that talented young players see no reason to work hard and develop their game, because it is so unlikely they will get a chance to play at the top level. And clubs don’t have a reason to seek out local youngsters and train them, as it is easier to buy a fully trained player from abroad. Limiting the number of foreign players would create incentives for both players and clubs to make the most of their talents. As a result, domestic crowds would rise as quality would improve proportionally with the development of local talent."}

The issue is that, should a playoff system be implemented, it is likely that these institutions would seek to undermine it in order to simply revert back to the old system. Should they withdraw their teams, the overall skill ceiling of college football would lower significantly. The fact that playoffs would occur during the Christmas period also means that owing to the cold weather at the time, the number of fans that would be drawn to the stadiums to pay money would be significantly lower than in regular season. The “Bowls” system makes sense because the only one near the Christmas period is the national championship which is considered high profile enough to draw a crowd."}

Firstly, it incentivises national athletic and sporting bodies to diligently check the background of coaches before their employment and continue to investigate them throughout the year. It is now in the interest of every single member of national sporting bodies and teams to ensure abuse doesn’t continue. In most it is currently in your interest to keep quiet, lest you risk disturbing the national programme or being ostracised by your federation. As a result coaches are far less likely to think these training methods will help them achieve success. Since it could see their athletes banned from the competition and lose their medals it makes using harsh training methods an immense risk to take. It would also mean they’re unlikely to ever get hired again if caught."}

The sports medical team is responsible for ‘preventing illness and injury’,  clearly something that is caused by harsh training. As do all those who are involved in sports. These athletes only exist in a professional capacity because bodies created the positions for the athletes to exist. If the world wants to pay people to perform and compete for them, then once that offer is made they have a moral duty to ensure that work is safe, since they are culpable in creating that work. Moreover, we give the IAAF power in the promise that by giving up localised power of judgement over sport, they can better protect athletes and creating a fairer sporting environment. Abusive training methods are a huge failure on the part of the IAAF and as such they must use the most powerful disincentive possible to them."}
{"id": 1530, "content": "Consider that athletes already subject themselves to the kinds of environments that most people actively avoid, and would probably be considered ‘harsh’ by the average person. These routinely involve long days, week after week, often planned out years in advance, practicing special diets and routines  and in some countries this may mean being isolated from home and family for years at a time. Athletes consent to having very harsh training in order to reach the prize, they’re used to putting themselves in extreme discomfort to achieve their goal. To the average person these things may seem abusive but an athlete considers these physical and mental demands differently. Communist teams used these kinds of training methods frequently and achieved lots of Olympic success,  why can’t an athlete choose to emulate these methods in the pursuit of their professional and personal dreams?"}

This seems unfair, why should someone have their professional dream denied to them because somebody else did something wrong? Banning an entire nation from a sporting competition expands this, individuals with no or little attachment to cases of abuse will also be punished and suffer, when they have taken no steps that deserve punishment. Punishments should fit the crime and this means punishing those who are responsible not innocents. It is right that the punishment should be harsh as it needs to deter coaches but this deterrent should be through steep penalties for the coach not for others."}

Sport is supposed to be a celebration of the human mind and body, and it is right that athletes that push themselves to the brink in search for glory receive due praise. The hugely skewed coverage of sport against women’s sports caused by the male world-view in the media is hugely unfair on female athletes, as they do not get the deserved recognition their male counterparts receive."}
{"id": 1533, "content": "The male world-view which dominates sports media and conveys to the public that women’s sport are inferior to men’s reinforce traditional gender stereotypes and deter young girls from becoming active in sport. Gender perceptions have obviously come a long way in the last 100 years, but the media classification of women’s sport as inferior to men’s is severely slowing this progress in the field of sport. Humans are social beings with esteem needs, and as social beings we like to be viewed in a positive light by our peers. This is best achieved on a general level by conforming to social expectations and norm. This also applies for societal conceptions of gender. The fact that the media deems women’s sport to be of lesser importance which (as we have seen) conveys to the public this message, reinforces the notion that sport is not a worthwhile activity for women and girls. Instead, it is an activity more appropriate for men and boys. This kind of discourse has the effect of moulding gender identities both in terms of how men perceive women and how women perceive themselves. In this way, the lack of media coverage of women’s sport fuels a self-affirming perception of gender which effectively denies many young girls a realistic choice of becoming engaged in sport as perceptions affect confidence in one’s ability; as a result of this gender bias boys as young as six rate themselves as being much more competent in sports than girls do. This is because increased coverage will make sport seem like a worthwhile activity for girls and women. As more women take part in sport, this has a further cyclical effect of re-affirming gender conceptions around sport which, in turn, induces further women to become engaged in sport. This is a desirable outcome from the government’s perspective because sport has a positive impact on the health of those who are physically active. Those who are physically active are not only less likely to suffer from things like Coronary Heart Disease and cancer, but they have also been shown to lead more psychologically happy lives due to the endorphins released while exercising, and the joy of feeling physically fit."}
{"id": 1534, "content": "Assuming we would have two equally muscular and equally fast male and female athletes, the current system clearly discriminates the female athlete by not allowing her to compete in the male league. It is against the very nature of sports to treat differently two athletes who have the same strength, speed, agility, dexterity, mental focus, determination, ambition based purely on their type of chromosomes. This is extremely important as most of the time the women’s competition gets less attention from the public and sponsors, as seen in the cases of Women’s National Basketball Association and National Women’s Football Association. So, by forcing them to stay in those leagues, you are denying potentially successful athletes fame, pride and money. The Giro Rosa, one of the biggest women cycling competition, offers a prize money of 460 Euros, which is a mere thousandth of the Tour de France's 450,000 Euro top prize."}

In order to incentivize women from around the world to get involved you need to give them role models; women who receive a lot of media coverage to whom they can look up to. Unfortunately, women’s sports don’t receive as much media coverage as men’s sports because they are considered to be less spectacular and thrilling. By allowing certain women, who have the necessary skills to compete against men to get this coverage you will give young girls the necessary motivation to start practicing sports, thus bringing a massive social benefit to the society. This happens already to successful women who are lucky enough to compete with men, as shown by Danica Patrick, so why should we stop here?"}
{"id": 1536, "content": "From the very beginning, it is important to understand that many sports are based on the physical attributes of the individuals. Whoever has the biggest muscles, whoever is fastest, whoever lifts a bigger weight, he is the one who will be declared champion. When we look at the statistics, they reveal the massive gap between the athletic capacities of the two sexes for example “The women's speed world records are all about 90 percent of the men's speed world records, in both short, middle and long distances.”(1). This only means, that although some women will win some sporting events, the vast majority of competition will still be won by men. As a result, more than ever, a message of female inferiority will be transmitted because in a direct competition between the sexes males will constantly win an element which was lacking in the past. This is defining sport in men’s terms not women’s. It says sports are men’s sports and relegates women’s to a secondary status at the same time having men constantly winning against women will show that this definition needs to be challenged. This is extremely important and it will come in direct contradiction to our efforts as a society to promote gender equality and to diminish stereotypes. We shouldn’t try to turn sports into a “Competition of the sexes”."}
{"id": 1537, "content": "Despite the fact that gender equality in sports often comes as an argument for applying this motion, it is rather the other way round. If indeed it is so important to let women compete in men’s leagues, on what ground do we ban men from competing in women’s leagues? If we look at it from the point of equality, it would be only normal that if women are equal to men, men are equal to women, and if females can move from one league to another, so should males. Either option we choose, there are negative consequences that follow. On one hand, if men are not allowed to migrate from one league to another, this whole plan will have a boomerang effect as it won’t resolve gender discrimination, it will only switch the discriminated gender. There is no basis on which males should be denied this advantage. On the other hand, if we do allow them to compete in women’s leagues, there won’t be male and female leagues, there will be two male leagues, as unfortunately, just as women won’t win many medals in the men’s leagues so men are much more likely to win in the women’s. As a result, female leagues would be destroyed if men are allowed to compete in them. Therefore, due to the consequences brought by any of the options, this proposal is undoubtedly damaging for sports."}
{"id": 1538, "content": "Governments and academic institutions have no special duty to give full access to all information that they generate and publish in academic journals to anyone who might want it. If they want to make their research public that is their prerogative, but it does not follow that they should then be expected to translate that work into an endless stream of different languages. If there is a desire by governments and institutions to aid in the academic development of the developing world, there are other ways to go about it than indiscriminately publishing their results and research into developing world languages. Taking on promising students through scholarships, or developing strategic partnerships with institutions in the global south are more targeted, less piecemeal means of sharing the body of global knowledge for example the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences funds junior scientists from the developing world working in their labs. It will prove to be a fairly ineffective education policy."}

In 2009, for example, the number of published research papers on science and technology exceeded 700,000. Translating all of these articles seems to be an obvious waste of time and resources for any government or institution to pursue and increasingly so when one considers the more than 30,000 languages in current use today. Translations today currently exist for articles and research that is considered useful. Any blanket policy is infeasible. The end result will be only a small number of articles translated into a finite number of languages. This is the status quo. Expanding it only serves to further confuse the academic community and to divert useful energies away from positive research to the quixotic task of translation."}

A work is the province of its creator in most respects, since it is from the mind and hand of its creator that it is born. But when the state opts to fund a project, it too becomes a part-owner of the ideas and creation that springs forth. The state should thus seek to make public the work it spends taxpayer money to create. This is in exactly the same way that when an employee of a company creates something presuming there is the correct contract the rights to that work go to the company not the employee. This is hampered by either the creator, or the government, retaining stricter forms of copyright, which effectively entitles the holder of the copyright to full control of the work that would not exist had it not been for the largesse of society. If state funded work is to have meaning it must be in the public sphere and reusable by the public in whatever form they wish. Simply put taxpayer bought so they own it."}
{"id": 1541, "content": "Current copyright law assigns too many rights, automatically, to the creator. Law gives the generator a work full copyright protection that is extremely restrictive of that works reuse, except when strictly agreed in contracts and agreements. Making the Creative Commons license the standard for publicly-funded works generates a powerful normalizing force toward a general alteration of people’s defaults on what copyright and creator protections should actually be like. The creative commons license guarantees attribution to the creator and they retain the power to set up other for-profit deals with distributors, something that is particularly useful for building programs that need to be maintained. The result is creation and then stagnation, as others do not expend the time and energy to seek special permissions from the creator. By normalizing the creative commons through the state funding system, more people will be willing to accept the creative commons as their private default. This means greater access to more works, for the enrichment of all. The result is that a norm is created whereby the assumption is that information should be open and shared rather than controlled and owned for profit by an individual or corporation. All governments recognise a right to freedom of information as part of freedom of expression making it the government’s responsibility to provide access to public information  and many are enabling this through creating freedom of information acts."}
{"id": 1542, "content": "We generally accept the principle that people who create something deserve to benefit from that act of creation as they should own that work. The owners of the work deserve to have the choice to benefit from their own endeavours through having copyright over that work. Sometimes this will mean the copyright will remain with the person who was paid to do the work but most of the time this will mean government ownership. Public funding does not change this fundamental ownership and the quixotic bargain state funding in exchange for mandatory creative commons licensing is a perversion of that ownership. The Texas Emerging Technology Fund is an example of the use of state funding in the private sector to produce socially useful technologies without thieving the ownership of new technologies from their creators. It would clearly be in taxpayers interest if the state is able to make a profit out of the investments that taxpayers funding creates as this would mean taxes could be lower.

{"id": 1543, "content": "The incentive of profit, rather than a creative productive drive, spurs the creation of new work. Without the guarantee of ownership over one’s work, the incentive to invest time and effort in its creation is significantly diminished. When the state is the only body willing to pay for the work and offers support only on these strict terms, there will be less interest in being involved with that work. Within a robust copyright system, individuals feel free to invest time in their pursuits because they have full knowledge that the fruits of their efforts will be theirs to reap. The current copyright system that is built on profit encourages innovation and finding the best use for technology. Even when government has been the source of innovation those innovations have only become widespread when someone is able to make a profit from it; the internet became big when profit making companies began opening it up. If the government wants partnerships with businesses, or universities that are not directly linked to government then it has to accept that those partners can make a profit. Furthermore, the inability of others to simply duplicate existing works as their own means they too will be galvanized to break ground on new ideas, rather than simply re-tread over current ideas and to cannibalize the fecund ground of creative commons works.

There may be scenarios in which think tanks, in need of funding for a purely positive project, ask for donations from anyone who believes in their values. Wanting to avoid any negative associations or any accusations of bias, they choose not to find out who their funders are, and thus they cannot disclose that information. For think tanks who claim independence by only asking for anonymous donors, this is no longer an option when they are forced to disclose. The attempt to create more objectivity actually removes one of the ways of being perfectly impartial."}

To a large extent this is an issue of trust; we (sometimes wrongly) trust our friends and others with information about us. We often trust faceless entities; companies and governments too though usually to less of an extent. But a lot of that trust is as a result of their willingness to tell us what they know about us, to provide information in return, or to provide methods for us to restrict what they know.

Facebook and social networks in general help teenagers on multiple levels to maintain and expand their circle of friends. Firstly, it lets you remain in touch with friends even if you are very far apart. As we live in an increasingly globalized world, friend circles tend to be broken up very easily. As a result, individuals need to be able to keep in touch in spite of the physical distance. Facebook enables them to do that. Thirdly, it allows young people to spend more time with the friends and people they already know through chat conversations, shared photos or status updates.

The most famous case is that of teenager Amanda Todd, who committed suicide after half-nude photos were posted online – she could not escape ridicule even after she moved schools, because photos remained online . Because real life actions are not enough to manage consequences of humiliating personal data, new ways suitable for the digital sphere have to be created, and that way is the right to be forgotten."}
{"id": 1561, "content": "The right to be forgotten is premised on the idea that internet requires additional rights beyond those in the real world. Offline there is no right to demand that people do not to talk about or show photos of your embarrassing moments. Provided that there is no privacy breach, once something is out in public, you cannot take it back. There is no rule enabling you to be forgotten in real life, even if things you have done harm you. Why then do rules have to be different for the internet? In 21st century the internet has become an integral part of our lives and of human communication that it is in fact just another reality for us. We do the same things there as we do in real life – socialise, engage in our hobbies etc. The only difference is that the internet provides us with greater opportunities, such as reaching more people, but that does not change the principle that human interaction online is pretty much the same as offline. If there is no right to be forgotten in real life, there should not be one in the digital one."}
{"id": 1562, "content": "Having a right to be forgotten means that people can be less responsible about what they share and how they act on the internet. Knowing that they can always remove all trace of what they did relieves people of the necessity to consider the consequences of what they are doing online. This is especially true for young adults: they often post unflattering information, such as pictures of them drunk or half-nude, or write offensive comments for the pay-out of immediate popularity in their peer group. However, what also prevents them from doing this is thinking about how that might affect them in the future. When they know that after some time they can delete their digital trace completely there is nothing preventing them from acting irresponsibly in hope of popularity. Such irresponsible behaviour then puts a burden on the state to fix the mess by applying and overseeing the right to be forgotten."}
{"id": 1563, "content": "Riots should not be tolerated in a free society as there are already legal and peaceful methods of dissenting such as through demonstrations, petitions, and contacting your representative in Parliament. It demonstrates a fundamental unwillingness to engage with not only the apparatus of the state, but society more generally. Rioters have no regard for the public, and the violence and damage they cause harms everyone. Riots tend to do little to actually challenge the state, but rather they tend to harm the most disadvantaged, those who happen to be in the vicinity of the mobs. The freedom of speech social media provides to its users is being fundamentally misused in the context of riots. Violence damages long after the event whereas those who have their freedom of speech curtailed for a few hours can swiftly voice their opinions once the riot has ended and the block lifted."}
{"id": 1564, "content": "When riots are on-going then the police needs to act but the safety of everyone involved should be considered to be paramount. If a riot will not disperse peacefully then the police often find they need to use batons, water cannon, or even in extremis tear gas or rubber bullets. It is the police’s duty to bring back public order by stopping riots through these methods. However this should not be at the expense of a much more preventative approach that shutting down social media networks would allow. If during instances of rioting the police are able to prevent those rioters from encouraging their friends to join them so expanding the riots then this is the right course of action to take. Rioters used social media like activists, to outmanoeuvre the police targeting areas where there was little police presence. Cutting off their means of communication would make this much harder and less effective."}
{"id": 1565, "content": "It is wrong to suggest that social networks only provide advantages to the rioters in a riot. Many of the networks that can be used are open to the public and even where they are not as with blackberry messenger the police and intelligence services can likely gain access. This means that the police can also benefit from rioters use of social networks. Allowing the rioters to communicate can help the police to track what the rioters are doing and potentially to intercept any plans before they can be put into action. The same logic is used with websites that promote extremist ideologies; it is often better to monitor them for the intelligence they provide. The police already monitor protest groups in this way during demonstrations and even use it to help police impromptu raves so will surely apply it to riots."}
{"id": 1566, "content": "The technology of anonymity can have the effect of providing needed security to dissidents seeking to make their country a better place, but it is just as likely to provide cover for the violent opportunists that arise in the midst of the chaos. When the state is unable to locate the culprits, and even to sort between those who are dissidents from those who are mere criminals, everyone involved gets blamed for the worst excesses of the chaos, discrediting the people with legitimate claims. Anonymity is a dangerous tool to give anyone, but particularly so in the context of violent uprising where it can be taken up by anyone. All governments, even authoritarian ones, have a right to defend their citizens from violent criminals capitalizing on mayhem. Western governments only make the cause of justice, often a tenuous one in these countries, all the more likely to go undefended, as governments are forced to clamp down on everyone, and find excuse in the looters to discredit the entirety of uprising with the same brush of destruction. Worse still is the possibility that the technology could fall into the hands of dangerous groups such as terrorists and militants who might use the greater safety of anonymity to increase their reach and scope of violence so turning the software against its creators."}
{"id": 1567, "content": "The developer of a new idea, theory, technology, invention, etc. has a fundamental intellectual property right. Academics in universities, through deliberate effort create new things and ideas, and those efforts demand huge amounts of personal sacrifice and invention in order to bear fruit. State funding is often given to pioneering researchers who eschew traditional roads in pursuit of new frontiers. Often there are no obvious profits to be immediately had, and it is only because of the desire of these individuals to expand the canon of human knowledge that these boundaries are ever pushed. It is a matter of principle that these academics be able to benefit from the fruits of their hard-won laurels. Certainly no amount of public funding to an institution can alter the fundamental relationship that exists between creator and the product of their endeavour. The state-funded University of Illinois, for example, has led the way in many technologies, such as fast charging batteries, and has spawned dozens of high-tech start-ups that have profited the university and society generally. Furthermore, this policy strips control of researchers’ control over their works’ use. State funding should obviously come with some requirements in terms of some sharing of revenues, etc., but it is also important to consider the extent of the impact work may offer the world. For example, the team that produced the atomic bomb at the University of Chicago became extremely worried after seeing what their invention could wreak, yet the power over their invention was taken over entirely by the state.

This does not however mean that it is right to simply cut them off from higher educational opportunities.

The Human Genome Project would have been an immense success either way but it is doubtful that its economic impact of $796billion would have been realised without open access. The rest of the economy benefits too.

Therefore any student who wants to go into areas not anticipated by the course they are enrolled with will find that they do not have access to the materials they require. They then face the cost of getting individual access to an online journal article which can be up to $42, despite there being almost zero marginal cost to the publisher.

The actual benefit of university education is less in learning content per se than engaging with new ideas critically, something that is frequently more difficult in an online environment. Moreover if only some countries or institutions were to implement such open access then it makes more sense for any students who are intending to study internationally to go elsewhere as they will still be able to use the resources made available by that university.

If one side is losing a conflict where both sides are attempting to steal the other's intellectual property (or the other has little to steal) the response may be something like the stuxnet attack that involves physical damage, this then would probably be considered an illegal use of force creating a thin line between a cyber-war and a real war.

Many teens send over 100 texts a day, it would clearly be very time consuming to read them all along with all other digital communication. Parents who meanwhile deem their children immature when it comes to social networking and gaming can instead impose user restrictions on the relevant websites and devices. In this case, only when children acquire sufficient digital maturity and responsibility can these controls be lifted.

For example, most professional footballers when young simply wanted to become the best player they could be, at the highest level they could reach. As Tottenham Hotspur Football Club defender Benoit Assou-Ekotto has stated, he had no desire to end up in an office job he wasn’t suited to so football became the means to ensure he could live out his life comfortably. Expelled from school, he assumed the profession he was naturally good at, just as a natural mathematician goes into engineering. Individuals who happen to be public figures still deserve the same rights to privacy as the rest of us; simply because they may have a degree of fame does not make them fair-game.

{"id": 1587, "content": "A right such as that to privacy is not absolute. Rights are general statements of principle that are then caveated and curtailed in the interests of society. When an individual seeks elevation to public office, he or she must accept that the role is a special one in society. As the representative of the people, the politician is more than just the holder of a job appointed by the people, but is the elected servant, whose duty is to lead. Leadership includes leading by example as well as simply directing policy. It is a strange relationship, and it is one that demands the utmost confidence in the holder. But confidence can only be developed through increased scrutiny and transparency. This means understanding the private life of the politician, since it so often informs their public life. Thus, when citizens place their political power in the hands of an elected representative, they gain the reciprocal right over that representative to have his or her life and character laid bare for their approval. This is the only way true representativeness may be achieved."}
{"id": 1588, "content": "When politicians see themselves constantly under the lens of public scrutiny, they are essentially forced to dedicate themselves wholesale to their duties as representatives. They are disincentivized in the extreme to pursue any transgressive or hypocritical activities behind closed doors, resulting in more energy dedicated to legislating, and less to lining their pockets or chasing interns, since the added risk of being discovered increases the cost of trying to conceal their foibles. Dominique Strauss-Kahn’s lurid sex life has thrown light on the sexual misconduct rife in French politics and has actually sparked a major effort to reform the system and a change to a more demanding culture towards politicians. A powerful probe into politicians’ private lives can only serve the cause of better governance."}
{"id": 1589, "content": "Privacy is a fundamental human right that is universal, a right that should be defended for all citizens, including those who govern us. People generally speaking have a basic respect for privacy. While some people may think their politicians owe them a special duty and thus have to give up certain privileges like privacy, the covenant between citizen and representative cannot be justified on such stringent grounds. A politician is effectively an employee of his constituents and the citizens of the polity. If this was justification for scrutiny into the private lives of elected officials then why should it not also be justification for intrusion into the private lives of unelected civil servants? Both these groups are doing a job for the public, but undertraining this job does not give the public the authority to intrude into their privacy beyond questions about whether they are qualified for the job. The duty of an elected politician is not so special as to demand an abrogation of his or her ability to enjoy a private life. If a right is to have meaning, it must apply to everyone with a semblance of equality. Making politicians fair game for reporters only serves to undermine the rights all citizens enjoy.

{"id": 1590, "content": "In some instances, when artists achieve success they face the enervating impulse that their achievement brings. They become satisfied and complacent with what they have, robbing them of their demiurgic drive. Worse, and more frequently, successful artists become embroiled in defending their work from pirates, downloaders, and other denizens of the internet. The result is artists wasting time in court, fighting lawsuits that sap them of time to actually focus on creating new works. Artists should be incentivized to look forward, not spend their time clinging to what they have already made. Obviously, they have a right to profit from their work to an extent, which is why a certain, reduced length of copyright is still important. But clearly the current length is far too great as artists retain their copyright until their death and many years after. Moreover once the artist has died it is difficult to see how copyright can be considered to be enhancing or even rewarding creativity; it simply becomes a negative weight on others creativity."}
{"id": 1591, "content": "Artists generating ideas and using their effort to produce an intangible good, be it a new song, painting, film, etc. have a property right over those ideas and the products that arise from them. It is the effort to produce a real good, albeit an intangible one, that marks the difference between an idea in someone’s head that he or she does not act upon, and an artistic creation brought forth into the world. Developing new inventions, songs, and brands are all very intensive endeavours, taking time, energy, and often a considerable amount of financial investment, if only from earnings forgone in the time necessary to produce the work. Artists deserve as a matter of principle to benefit from the products of the effort of creation. Each is a real thing, even if one can be touched while the other is intangible in a physical sense. Copyright is the only real scheme that can provide the necessary protection for artists to allow them to enjoy the fruits of their very real labours.

Art is the expression of its creator’s sense of understanding of the world, and thus that expression will always have special meaning to him or her. How that work is then used thus remains an active issue for the artist, who should, as a matter of justice be able to retain a control over its dissemination. That control can extend, as with the bequeathing of tangible assets, to designated successors, be the trusts, family, or firms. In carrying out the wishes of the artist, these successors can safeguard that legacy in their honor. Many artists care about their legacies and the future of their artistic works, and should thus have this protection furnished by the state through the protection of lengthy copyrights."}
{"id": 1593, "content": "Artists may rely on their creative output to support themselves. This is certainly no crime, and existing copyright laws recognize this fact. Artists rarely have pensions of the sort that people in other professions have as they are rarely employed by anyone for more than a short period. They also recognize the need of artists to be able to support their dependents, many of whom too rely on the artist’s output. In the same way financial assets like stocks can be bequeathed to people for them to profit, so too must copyright be. Copyright is a very real asset and financial protection that should be sustained for the sake of artists’ financial wellbeing and that of their loved ones."}

Without the guarantee of ownership over one’s artistic work, the incentive to invest in its creation is significantly diminished. Within a robust copyright system, individuals feel free to invest time in their pursuits because they have full knowledge that the fruits of their efforts will be theirs to reap. Even if the number of true successes is very small in the whole of artistic output, the chance of riches and fame can be enough for people to make the gamble. If their work were to quickly leave their control, they would be less inclined to do so.

The sale of surveillance technology to undemocratic regimes stands against the avowed aims of democracies and against their strategic interests in bolstering democracy abroad and maintaining a reputation for fair dealing. For this reason it is perfectly legitimate for governments to ban the corporations within their borders from selling dangerous technologies to foreign governments.

It shows that the undemocratic regimes cannot be trusted with the ability to spy on their people. This signal has several effects. An example of this international shaming affecting is the international bans on the use of landmines. Various states created a framework, the Ottawa Convention,  in which their condemnation pressured nearly every other state, including authoritarian regimes, to follow suit. They can point to this ban as an example of their government’s desire to make a better world and not to increase repression for the sake of power or profit. In the undemocratic states themselves, the regime leaders will be faced with a significant public relations blow as they come under criticism. This serves to embolden and empower holders of dissenting opinions and to spark pro-democratic discourse. In the international community it makes an emphatic value judgement on the merit of certain systems of government, namely the superiority of democracy and government accountability to the people, principles most non-democracies still pay some form of lip-service to.

The biggest customers of Western surveillance technology companies are wealthy democracies. The United Kingdom, for example, has one of the most-watched populations in the world, with a saturation of CCTV cameras far in excess of any dictatorship. These powers are no less simply because the government is composed in part of elected officials. The security establishment is appointed, not elected, and their servicemen are promoted from within. It is base hypocrisy to pretend that the security systems are inherently more just when employed in democratic states than in undemocratic ones.

This led to a reduction in the breadth of goods and services to niche markets. Targeted advertising helps to alleviate this issue by allowing customers of eclectic tastes to actually find services they are interested in outside the mainstream, enriching their own lives in the process. The internet is vast, and it is often difficult to sift out things that might be interesting to the individual consumer from all the information available. Targeted advertising is one of the most effective ways of providing this information to people. This creates a better experience for internet users because it provides a far easier means of finding goods and services, groups and ideas, that would interest them, often from sources they might not have otherwise been aware. When Facebook furnishes this service to advertisers, users are shown ads that fit their profiles, ones they might find interesting."}

Furthermore, this sort of targeted advertising, while focusing on general demographics and programmes, does succeed in hitting its mark most of the time. Thus, there is a value in having the programming, and it is absent stereotype. All of this advertising is simply the continuation of firms’ and organisations age-old effort to better understand their clients and to cater for their needs and should not be considered any differently to adverts being placed as a result of working out what programs are watched by what demographic. TV is also moving towards targeting ads to individuals through information such as household income and purchasing history, this is information that is not private and online usage should be considered the same way."}

Until recently advertisers were forced to use ads that went into the world basically at random, hitting everyone and not necessarily reaching the desired audience. This meant that producers could rarely target small markets, and thus advertising and mass media products all focused on large groups. With the advent of targeted marketing, producers can now afford to compete for business and to advertise their services to the groups that actually want what they have to sell. Thus, businesses have been able to flourish that once would have languished without access to a proper market. An example of this is the targeting by niche fashion boutiques targeting the diffuse but expansive “hipster” market.

An example of this is Eircom which, when it was the state utility, provided broadband of a lower quality and at higher price than most private providers.

It is harder for opponents of government regulations to voice their opinions online when they have no viable alternative to the state-controlled network. The internet is a place of almost limitless expression and it has empowered more people to take action to change their societies. That great tool of the people must be protected from any and all threats, and most particularly the state that could so profit from the curtailment of internet freedom."}
{"id": 1605, "content": "Freedom of speech certainly may be curtailed when real harms can be shown to arise from it. Extremist sites serve as centers of dangerous dissent, whose members threaten all of society. They promote a message that is fundamentally bad speech, because it cannot it cannot be argued with and promotes aims that are so anathema to free society that its dissemination represents a true threat to people’s safety. The threat extremists represent to free society demands that their right to speech online be curtailed. Thus, there is essentially no real loss of valuable speech in censoring extremist websites."}
{"id": 1606, "content": "ISPs are ultimately private providers of a service. Because of this they should retain the right to restrict that service to certain groups. So long as ISPs make public their policy for what constitutes extremism so that consumers can decide if they want to opt into it, there is no real issue. There are many filters available to users to screen out certain materials already, for example internet providers offer customers the option to block adult content,  and this is merely an extension of this approach. Businesses must be able to sort their own ethos. Some ISPs may not opt to use this power given to them by the state, but others may not wish to carry content they consider dangerous. Because extremism is on the very fringe of speech and opinion, and because of the potential dangers that can arise from it, it is only right that the state give some ability to ISPs to block objectionable content."}
{"id": 1607, "content": "As the access providers for the internet ISPs are best placed to implement policies for blocking extremist sites and so are the natural option for deciding when and which sites to block. Furthermore, because the state is often slow due its extensive bureaucracy, it is less able to respond with alacrity to extremist sites popping up online. ISPs on the other hand are likely to be able to act as soon as they are informed of the existence of a website whereas working through government would simply add an extra layer of requests and orders. The ISPs blocking the site also creates a fire break between the state and the action so not giving the extremists the ammunition that state intervention might give them. Essentially, the good result of eliminating these sites from public access is accomplished faster, more effectively, and with lesser backlash than if any other agent did the blocking."}
{"id": 1608, "content": "No matter how distasteful, or extreme, their opinions may be, everyone should have the right to voice them freely and publicly. That is the very essence of a free society. When groups presume to judge good speech from bad, and to shut off the channel by which the designated bad speech may flow, it abrogates its duty to protect the rights of all. When ISPs do this, which they do when they block sites they designate as extremist, they rob the people of their fundamental role as the final arbiters of acceptable speech in the marketplace of ideas, taking that power unto themselves without any form of democratic or moral mandate. Such a state of affairs is anathema to the continuation of a free society. But that is not the case here, where the participants are few and scattered, and those who would take exception to what the extremists have to say can easily opt out online. When extremists try to organize terrorist action online, then the government should step into protect its citizens. That duty does not fall to the ISPs."}
{"id": 1609, "content": "ISPs are businesses, not scholars or governments. They do not have the expertise to effectively define the parameters of what constitutes extremism or when a certain site is such, and cannot gauge the extent of damage the site is having. If governments give the power to ISPs to take down extremist sites they are giving these companies the ability to dissipate the freedom of the internet on the basis of its own judgment. Even if the state sets guidelines for ISPs to follow, it will be difficult to police their decisions effectively and will set the dangerous precedent that service providers should have a degree of power over what content citizens can consume. The ISPs also face the risk of legal challenge by groups blocked that claim to not be advocates of extremism at all so burdening the ISPs with long and costly court battles which would effectively be being fought on behalf of the government. Ultimately private actors cannot be given the authority of the public censor."}
{"id": 1610, "content": "A major risk with any extremist organization is that its members, when put under significant legal pressure, will go underground, or find other means of communicating, or use any ISPs that not blocking extremist content. The power of ISPs, or the state for that matter, to actually stop the development of extremist networks is limited, as they will be able still to organize in secret, or even semi-publicly, via social networks and hidden websites that evade detection by the censors. As Mark Burgess, director of the World Security Institute warns ““too much focus on closing down websites could also be counter-productive, since it likely forces terrorist websites to go underground to the so-called ‘deep’ or hidden web.” Terrorist groups visible profile would be blunted, but it would not guarantee any positive gains in terms of stamping down on the number of extremists. Indeed, when extremists are driven from public channels it will be ever harder for the government to keep track of their doings and of their leaders. The result of this censorship is a more careful organization that now has a sense of victimhood against the society that censors it, which it can use to encourage even more extreme acts from its members and can spin to its advantage during recruitment efforts. By leaving them in the open extremists feel more comfortable acting within the confines of the law and are thus less dangerous, even if they are more visible."}
{"id": 1611, "content": "The gathering of personal data that companies undertake is done in a fashion that is fundamentally invasive of individuals’ privacy. When individuals go online they act as private parties, often enjoying anonymity in their personal activities. Companies, particular online services, collate information and seek to use it to market products and services that are specifically tailored to those individuals. In the context of the internet, this means that individuals’ activities online are in fact susceptible to someone else’s interference and oversight, stealing from them the privacy and security the internet has striven to provide since its inception. At the most basic level, the invasion of privacy that collating and using private data gleaned from customers is unacceptable. This can lead to serious abuses of individuals’ private information by corporations, or indeed other agents that might have less savoury uses for the information, most obviously the more places your personal information is the more likely it is to be lost in a data breach with 267million records exposed in 2012. Giving companies that are driven by profit motive to sell on their customers’ data to anyone that might offer a suitable price stands as an absolute theft of personal information and privacy."}

Data breaches have been rapidly increasing  and although the total number declined from 412 million exposed records in 2011 to 267 million in 2012 this has increasingly been due to hacking rather than simple negligence. As individuals see companies as being uncaring of their information they tend to punish them in the market.

{"id": 1613, "content": "An individual’s idea only truly belongs solely to them so long as it rests in their mind alone. When they disseminate their ideas to the world they put them in the public domain, and should become the purview of everyone to use. Artists and creators more generally, should not expect some sort of ownership to inhere in an idea they happen to have, since no such ownership right exists in reality. Thus recognizing something like a property right over intangible assets is contrary to reason, since doing so gives monopoly power to individuals who may not make efficient or equitable use of their inventions or products. Physical property is a tangible asset, and thus can be protected by tangible safeguards. Ideas do not share the same order of protection even now because they exist in a different order to physical reality. However, some intellectual property is useful in encouraging investment and invention, allowing people to engage their profit motives to the betterment of society as a whole. To an extent one can also sympathize with the notion that creators deserve to accrue some additional profit for the labour of the creative process, but this can be catered for through Creative Commons non-commercial licenses which reserve commercial rights. This is because art is a social good of a unique order, with its purpose not purely functional, but creative. It only has value in being experienced, and thus releasing these works through creative commons licenses allows the process of artistic experience and sharing proceeds unhindered by outmoded notions of copyright. The right to reap some financial gain still remains for the artists, as their rights still hold over all commercial use of their work. This seems like a fair compromise of the artist’s right to profit from their work and society right to experience and grow from those works. Intellectual Property: In Principle."}
{"id": 1614, "content": "The nature of the internet and mass media on the 21st century is such that many artists can benefit from the freedom and flexibility that creative commons licenses furnish to them. Wider use by other artists and laymen alike helps artistic works “go viral” and to gain major impact that allow the artist to generate a name for his or herself and to attain the levels of earnings conventional copyrights are meant to help artists generate but that ultimately hamstring them. A major example of this is the band Nine Inch Nails, which opted in 2008 to begin releasing its albums through the creative commons. After all, the artists still retain control of the commercial uses of their work and are guaranteed under creative commons licensing regulations to be credited by users of their content. The state should thus facilitate the sharing by mandating the distribution of art of all kinds under creative commons licenses."}
{"id": 1615, "content": "Whatever the end product, be it music, film, sculpture, or painting, artistic works are the creations of individuals and a property right inheres within them belonging to their creators. An idea is just an idea so long as it remains locked in someone’s mind or is left as an unfinished sketch, etc. But when the art is allowed to bloom in full, it is due to the artist and the artist only. The obsession, the time, the raw talent needed to truly create art is an incredible business, requiring huge investment in energy, time, and effort. It is a matter of the most basic, and one would have hoped self-evident, principle that the person who sacrificed so much to bring forth a piece of art should retain all the rights to it and in particular have the right to profit from it. The ethereal work of the artist is every bit as real as the hard work of a machine. Mandating that all forms of art be released under a creative commons license is an absolute slap in the face to artists and to the artistic endeavour as a whole. It implies that somehow the work is not entirely the artist’s own, that because it is art it is somehow so different as to be worthy of being shunted into the public sphere without the real consent of the artist. This is a gross robbing of the artist’s right over his or her own work. If property rights are to have any meaning, they must have a universal protection. This policy represents a fundamental erosion of the right to property, and attacks one sector of productive life that is essential for the giving of colour to the human experience. This policy serves only to devalue that contribution. John Marshall Review of Intellectual Property Law."}
{"id": 1616, "content": "Art is the expression of its creator’s sense of understanding of the world, and thus that expression will always have special meaning to him or her that no amount of reinterpretation or external appreciation can override. How a work is used once released into the public sphere, whether expanded, revised, responded to, or simply shown without their direct consent, thus remains an active issue for the artist, because those alternative experiences are all using a piece of the artist in its efforts. Artists deserve to have that piece of them treated in a way they see as reasonable. It is a simple matter of justice that artists be permitted to maintain the level of control they desire, and it is a justice that is best furnished through the conventional copyright mechanism that provides for the maximum protection of works for their creators, and allows them to contract away uses and rights to those works on their own terms. Many artists care about their legacies and the future of their artistic works, and should thus have this protection furnished by the state through the protection of copyright, not cast aside by the unwashed users of the creative commons. Samuel Beckett is a great example of this need. Beckett had exacting standards about the fashion in which in his plays could be performed. He would lack that power under this policy, meaning either the world would have been impoverished for want of his plays, or he would have been impoverished for want of his rights to his work. These rights are best balanced through the aegis of copyright as it is, not under the free-for-all of the creative commons license."}
{"id": 1617, "content": "Profit is as much a factor in artists’ decision to produce work, if not more so, than the primordial urge to create. Without the guarantee of ownership over one’s artistic work, the incentive to invest in its creation is certainly diminished. Within a strong copyright system, individuals feel free to invest time in their pursuits because they have full knowledge that the final product of their labours will be theirs to enjoy. If their work were to immediately leave their control, they would most certainly be less inclined to do so. Furthermore, the inability of others to simply duplicate existing works as their own means they too will be galvanized to break ground on new ideas, rather than simply re-tread over current ideas and to adapt existing works to markets. Art thrives by being new and original. Copyright protections shield against artistic laziness and drive the creative urges of the artistically inclined to ever more interesting fields. John Marshall Review of Intellectual Property Law."}
{"id": 1618, "content": "Artists as they are often not paid for anything else may rely on their creative output to support themselves. This is certainly no crime, and existing copyright laws recognize this fact. Artists often rely wholly on their ability to sell and profit from their work. This policy serves to drain them of that potential revenue, as their work is shunted into creative commons, and available to all. Artists often also have families to support, and putting the added financial burden on them of stripping them of their copyright only serves to further those problems as they exist. A robust system of copyright is a much better protection to struggling and successful artists alike who like all talented individuals seek to assuage their material wants. Artists cannot live on appreciation alone. With much less secure copyright many would have to find other work."}

For the community and the individual speaking and learning their own language will give immigrants a sense of belonging. They are part of a community that they know and understand because it speaks the same language even before they come to know the rest of the country. This provides security, belonging, and close contact with relatives. For the community it means keeping their own customs and identity alive, in a few cases this may actually be contributing to conserving a language. For the country as a whole this does not represent a threat as there can be many different levels of identity that all intermix. Instead it provides an opportunity; it diversifies the country.

A common language represents a unifying framework under which a state can function properly by promoting mutual help and understanding inside the population. This is the case of Papua New Guinea where there is no central authority.

This is something the government did not invent and not something it can simply wash out of society. Shelving the bill would not suddenly create tolerance from Ugandan society towards the gay community but instead would isolate and impose a threat to the LGBT community. Others would have tried to create laws anti-gay laws. This ‘kill the Gays bill’ was originally intended to include the death penalty for some homosexual acts such as when one of the participants is a minor, HIV-positive, disabled or a \"serial offender\".

Shortly after the president’s letter to parliament requesting the shelving of the bill was revealed, thousands of Ugandans took on to the streets protesting against the move complaining that homosexuality will never be allowed in their society. Known gay Ugandans were forced not to move while others were attacked in their homes. Long before the bill was passed by parliament, homosexuals and LGBT activists were beaten, harassed and killed by their fellow Ugandans. David Kato a leading figure in demanding equal rights for the gay minority was killed in January 2011. The situation may have worsened had the bill been shelved as angry Ugandans would attack the gay community seeking revenge, something that they made clear would happen during the anti-gay protests.

They assume there is a designer, so they look for holes in evolutionary theory and claim only a designer can explain the gaps. When new evidence arises that gives a natural explanation of the phenomenon in question, the Creationists backpedal and start looking for new holes. No amount of evidence could convince a Creationist because his belief is not based on evidence, but rather on a usually religion-driven opposition to evolution on a political and belief level. A science proves itself through experimentation and submitting research for peer review. Creationism fears scrutiny by real scientists. Instead supporters of creationism attempt to further its agenda through politics and courts, where science is not the main goal, but popularity and where expertise is not in science but in law (Dawkins, 2006). Creationism couches itself in the language of science and does its best to look respectable in the eyes of the public. For example, in rebranding as Intelligent Design, Creationists sought to appear less overtly religious. These attempts show the illegitimacy of Creationism.

Allowing such techniques would help to equalise the prosecution and defence; after all, the aim of court is not to blindly prosecute the defendant, but to ascertain whether he or she is in fact guilty before any prosecution occurs.

In this way, they could actually evade intelligence services and the police by using different forms of communication, such as encrypting messages or using disposable mobile phones. Revealing the capabilities of our intelligence agencies could create harms which far outweigh any potential benefits of intercept evidence .

By producing anything desired cheaply and more accessibly, without even having to leave your house, they encourage people consume much more than they otherwise would. This happens because individual consumers tend not to be concerned about the sustainability implications of every purchase: they will do so even less when 3D printers allow instant gratification. On one hand, it can make people more dependent on material possessions, which makes it harder for them to attain more sustainable forms of happiness. Additionally, this eventually leads to more waste and overproduction, reversing all the potential benefits of industrial 3D printing."}

Much in the same way one can steal music online, blueprints for products can be decoded or stolen and subsequently reproduced at almost no expense. It may be impossible to determine where this has been done.14 This is unjust in itself, but it also creates a large deterrent from innovating by removing the profit incentive.

Anybody could have an idea and implement it into a solid product, which is cheap to produce in your own home without economies of scale. There are already examples all over the world of people creating innovating prototypes and attracting investors16.

Furthermore, things are only actually produced after they have been purchased, reducing waste even more."}

Household 3D printers give people the possibility of producing otherwise inaccessible things for a minimal cost, up to hundreds of times cheaper than their current store price20. Numerous websites, such as Thingiverse21, already act as databases for free printable designs. This trend would allow people to save thousands on necessities: food, appliances, medicine, and human organs are some examples. Even systems for power production or more efficient ways of collecting sustainable energy could be created. This would make scarcity disappear as we know it, and thus tackle one of society’s greatest problems.

Therefore, simply saying that there is a risk that printers will be misused is not sufficient grounds for banning them altogether. If technology makes it easier for people to do what they want, this is a good thing; if people then want to do things that we consider harmful this is a problem in itself. The solution is not to ban an entire means of production in order to stop a minority from producing dangerous things, but to educate people about the risks so they can freely make better decisions. Making it harder for people to do bad things is useless, furthermore, since those that wish to purchase a gun or take drugs can already find ways of doing so without 3D printers.

{"id": 1647, "content": "It is unfair to compel people to take their leisure at a time that is not of their convenience. Workers who have to work a certain number of hours per week just to cover their costs should not be obliged to take their leisure time at a time when they cannot access services such as shops and banks. For those with no religious conviction there is no particular benefit for Sunday being their day of leisure. Instead a more fluid relationship between work and leisure ensures that those with the least available free time can take it to their greatest convenience."}
{"id": 1648, "content": "It is already difficult enough for members of minority religions to have time for their own religious celebrations. It seems unlikely that employers would be likely to respect the rights of other religious groups to celebrate their own days of rest if employers were already compelled to recognise Sundays as a compulsory day of rest. Equally, for the state to identify one particular day as the ‘religious’ day worthy of commemoration would be a statement that one particular religious persuasion was in some way superior to others."}
{"id": 1649, "content": "Many people work long hours not out of greed or obsession but out of simple necessity. To deny people the right to work when they need to is unfair and, potentially, financially crippling. In an ideal world everybody would have a good work-life balance but that is not the reality faced by millions of workers, even in developed economies. Obliging workers to lose a day’s pay when that may impoverish then and their families is unlikely to enhance their family life, their level of relaxation, their spiritual experience or their access to leisure services."}
{"id": 1650, "content": "Religion is intimately linked to culture and people’s identity. To many people who believe that religion, it is very important to them. In a society with respect for human rights, people are able to not just have their religious beliefs, but put them in to practice."}
{"id": 1651, "content": "It is a basic tenant of all religions that they divide humanity into ‘us’ and ‘them’ – believers and non-believers. However, the divisions of society perceived by religious believers do not stop there, and have a tendency to reflect the social and moral views of an earlier and far less progressive age. As well as condemning those who practice other faiths, or who choose to follow no faith, they have fought, and continued to fight, the expansion of the rights of women and of socially marginalised castes, among other social groups. All of the major churches and sects have had to be dragged kicking and screaming into the modern world, and most of them are still desperately trying to ignore the existence of modernity. While justifying their political and moral positions through obtuse and deliberately obscure interpretations of religious texts, obscure texts even the mainstream interpretations of major religions are usually sexist, frequently racist and almost universally homophobic. Preventing access to contraception is the single largest block to women getting out of poverty. There are many other examples of the excesses and double standards of mainstream religion –  too many examples to pick one."}
{"id": 1652, "content": "In a world consumed by the belief that the only thing in life that genuinely matters is money, religious bodies serve as a welcome reminder that other activities- besides “wealth creation”- can be meaningful and valuable too. In addition to promoting morality and spirituality within society they have also, historically, been sponsors of great art and music. The fact that religions are also international organisations bring perspectives that believers in some countries may find uncomfortable, but which act as a reminder of more universal truths – primarily, altruism."}
{"id": 1653, "content": "At times of great need or celebration, religious communities and organisations are often the only organisations that seem fit to the task of marking them. This principle applies both in people’s own lives, with the birth of a child or the death of a loved one, but it can also apply to national events. At times of great tragedy it is frequently the main religious community that is expected to sum up the mood of a nation and to provide explanation and succour. It is difficult to see how a politician, jurist or academic could fulfill that role so well. It is interesting that although we may ignore the day-to-day role of religion in society and in communities, at moments of great trial, or great celebration, it is to religious rites that most people turn."}
{"id": 1654, "content": "The world is full of suffering and pain among innocent people. If God is good and all-powerful then why is this the case? Either God does not exist or he is not worth believing in since he does not care about human suffering."}
{"id": 1655, "content": "Religions through the ages, and still today, have been agents of repression, sexism, elitism, homophobia, and - most of all - conflict, war, and racial hatred. The very nature of belief in received wisdom means that it must be, at its core, a conservative and regressive force. Moreover the positive moral rules that religions claim to promote tend to have existed independently of those religions – the world did not have to wait for the ten commandments to learn that murder and theft was wrong, but it waited until the 19th Century to reach a consensus that Slavery was wrong. Whatever small amount of psychological comfort religious belief may give, the evils it is responsible for in the social and political worlds easily outweigh it."}
{"id": 1656, "content": "With regards to any proposition the only consistent and rational view is to assume that it is not true unless sufficient evidence is put forward to nullify that assumption. The proposition need also be falsifiable, that is to say, there must be some potential fact that could be proven in order to disprove it. God is unfalsifiable because there is nothing."}
{"id": 1657, "content": "Godly wisdom is not the same as human wisdom and cannot be subject to the same criticism. The nature of humanity means that our ability to understand God’s wisdom is fundamentally limited; and thus arguments based on morality or science are irrelevant – what matters is that God has revealed Himself."}
{"id": 1658, "content": "Freedom to religion is widely considered to be a fundamental human right. Freedom of religion is very similar to freedom of expression and is an inalienable right that cannot be taken away by the state. Article 18 of the universal declaration of human rights states “Everyone has the right to freedom of… religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.”  In addition to this, many people consider religion to be the single most important thing in their life. Under the status quo, many people are inhibited in their ability to practise their religion to its fullest degree. This not only causes them great distress due to how important this is to them but is a breach of their human rights. The government has an obligation to provide people with a basic standard of life and thus must pass this legislation."}
{"id": 1659, "content": "People who are caused distress and have their religious freedom limited by their government are likely to feel disillusioned with and sidelined by their government. They will wonder why other religious groups can follow all the teachings of their faith while the government limits theirs. This kind of limitation of how to worship or what traditions and beliefs to follow can be part of the cause that leads to members of that religion feeling not welcome and discriminated against, ultimately leading to extremism. Allowing religious beliefs to override government laws would relieve these feelings and dramatically improve religious people’s relationship with the state. This improvement in relationship would severely reduce the likelihood of anti-government feelings and general civil unrest."}
{"id": 1660, "content": "Currently, the state and organised religion are often seen as diametrically opposed. This causes a lot of tension between the government and religious communities within the country, as well as between the state and states which hold religion more highly. As the Bishop of Liverpool puts it “Church and politics are not two parallel lines; rather they are two live wires, side by side, which when they touch should ignite and explode.”  Thus when Rowan Williams suggested Sharia might be accommodated his comments created a political storm. This legislation would show that we do value and respect religious freedom and rights and would improve our relationships on both of these fronts."}
{"id": 1661, "content": "The role of the state is to protect its people and to create the conditions for its people’s prosperity. The Church does not share these objectives. The Church’s objectives are, instead, to either convert as many people as possible to its own religion, and to ‘save souls’ brining people into its own perceived afterlife. The current confusion of state and Church, therefore, is likely to cloud the state’s judgement and limit the state’s ability to provide the maximum possible prosperity and security for its people."}
{"id": 1662, "content": "As it stands, the Church of England’s involvement in the state actually has little effect on it. Decisions are taken by the Prime Minister and his/her government rather than by religious officials and indeed the Church of England can often be a vehicle for the government’s views rather than the Church having an influence on government. As Bishop of Rochester Nazir-Ali states ‘The church is seen simply as the religious aspect of society, there to endorse any change which politicians deem fit to impose upon the public.’  Therefore, separating the church and the state will make little difference in terms of the way the state is actually run but may result in a reduction of the influence of the government on some of the population. Why, exactly, does it exist?’, The Spectator, 7 April 2009."}
{"id": 1663, "content": "Every time a life is extinguished, some amount of present and future good vanishes from the world. All the good things that that person would have experienced – joy, accomplishment, delight – will no longer occur. Similarly, all the beneficially effects they will have one other people, from productively working to loving their family, will also not occur. True, people also experience unhappy times, and they sometimes negatively affect others, but in all but an exceptionally small number of cases, the net contribution of a human life to total utility is positive (indeed, if it weren’t, we probably wouldn’t consider death to be bad). Even though there will be some fluctuations in how much each life contributes to total utility – a happy doctor probably adds more utility than a miserable meter maid – it is overwhelmingly likely that saving the five lives will result in a situation of greater utility than preserving the life of the one."}
{"id": 1664, "content": "Every person who dies leaves behind people whose lives are made dramatically worse by the loss of a loved one. The average person, by continuing to live, helps those around them in a multitude of ways: love for their family, productive enterprise, and any philanthropic behavior in which they may engage. Out of sheer sympathy for the loved ones of the dead, and others who depend on their continued survival, one ought to minimize the number who die, and thus save the five."}
{"id": 1665, "content": "While people die all the time, it is exceptionally rare for one human being to intentionally cause the death of another, even for a perceived “greater good.”  The difference is that when one actively kills, one causes the killing. They bring about something that would not otherwise have happened, and they set it in motion. What is key is the moral actor’s role in the very inception of the threat to the life of another person. Their responsibility for the resulting death is far greater than had they committed the same non-action as every other person who wasn’t present to make the decision at all."}
{"id": 1666, "content": "Different people’s lives may indeed weigh differently. Some people may go on to cure cancer, while others may become serial killers. However, we do not know who will do what with their future, and it is an act of immense hubris to perform calculations that presume otherwise. We could be killing future a serial-rapist in order to save future a philanthropist who funds Somali famine-relief, but we could just as easily be doing the opposite. We are in a state of incredible ignorance as to what these individuals will choose to do. It truly is to “play god”, and vastly overestimate our ability to judge who will be good for the world and who will be bad."}
{"id": 1667, "content": "While simply consulting our moral intuitions case-by-case is not always reliable (indeed many people have contradictory moral intuitions), certain moral intuitions are needed in order to morally theorize. If a moral theory was impeccably well thought out, but prescribed actions completely at odds with our moral intuitions (such as advocating indiscriminate assault and robbery), then we would rightly dismiss it out of hand. When it comes to killing, our intuition prohibiting it is foundational and widely held."}
{"id": 1668, "content": "Knowing that we have agreed that there are situations where we can decide to kill others for the greater good makes us fearful of the prospect of others visiting such judgment on us (independent of whether such an act is objectively right or wrong). Immense psychological harm accrues from knowing that other people may actively judge oneself to be worth killing for an external purpose. Moreover, an acceptance of killing tends to brutalize society and make people more receptive to the idea of killing in general, which leads human beings to behave more violently."}
{"id": 1669, "content": "To know that one has actually killed another human being will haunt the moral agent forever. Instances of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder for soldiers returning for warzones are increasingly reported, suggesting that a situation of killing very often warps the killer’s life . This holds true even for people not directly and viscerally involved in killings, such as the incredible guilt felt by the team of the Manhattan project."}
{"id": 1670, "content": "If we recognize a duty to actively go out of our way (and indeed, carry the burden of killing another person) to save another person just because it’s in our power, then all sorts of new obligations open up. For instance, we are now obliged to donate all of our disposable income to charity because we could do so and each save dozens of lives a year. The reason why some religious institutions canonize people is precisely because their philanthropy is exceptional and beyond what could be expected of the average person: people like Damien of Molokai, who traveled to an island to help people suffering from leprosy, knowing that he would eventually contract the disease in the process . While such actions may be praiseworthy, it is implausible that they would be morally obligatory."}
{"id": 1671, "content": "Museums are a crucial source of inspiration and education for our increasingly important creative industries (e.g. art, design, fashion, and architecture). As the Secretary of the National Union of Teachers described, ‘free access means that every child can benefit from the treasure chest…regardless of the depth of the parental pocket’ (Russell & Taylor, 2007). Free access is an investment in the future of both the education and creative sectors of the economy and therefore has long-term benefits in securing prosperity for the whole of society. Similarly, tourism is an important sector of our economy and many visitors will be deterred from visiting our country if they think it will be very expensive to visit its great museums and galleries. Tourists do contribute hugely to government revenues through the indirect taxes they pay and the jobs they generate, tourism is a £115bn industry,(BBC News, 2010) so free museum access to support the tourism industry is a sensible investment."}
{"id": 1672, "content": "If museums are entirely funded by the state, they will have little incentive to increase visitor numbers and to make their collections exciting and accessible for all. The need to attract paying customers concentrates the minds of museum and gallery directors upon the needs of the public and produces imaginative and popular exhibitions, as well as adding value through guided tours, lectures and tie-ins with television programmes. All of this ensures that more people, not less visit museums. In addition, if museums were made entirely reliant upon public funding, it is likely that money would be channeled to those institutions the government felt were most important, forcing smaller, local or more specialist museums to close. While it is an extreme example totalitarian states such as Nazi Germany point to the dangers of allowing politicians control over interpretations of national identity and presentations of other cultures. Even a much more liberal government is likely to want the arts that it funds to represent it in a good light."}
{"id": 1673, "content": "The number of priests in developed countries is on the decline. In Ireland in 2007 160 priests died but only nine were ordained to replace them. It is expected that the number of priests in Ireland will fall from 4758 in 2008 to 1500 by 2028. The requirement of celibacy drastically reduces the pool from which the church can select priests and means that the church is not always getting the “best and the brightest”. As a result even many within the church believe the demand for celibacy should be ended."}
{"id": 1674, "content": "It sets the priest apart from the modern world and the experiences of his parishioners. Originally, around 1100 the Gregorian Reform movement in the church was keen to enforce celibacy for fear that too many married priests would leave church property and benefices to their children, or create local priestly dynasties."}
{"id": 1675, "content": "The prospect of celibacy draws sexually dysfunctional men to the priesthood. They hope that by totally denying their sexuality, they will not engage in deviant acts, but unfortunately they often cannot overcome their deviant desires. Permitting priests to marry would bring men with healthy sexual desires to the priesthood."}
{"id": 1676, "content": "The celibate priest has a unique understanding of the power of self-control and the giving of self, which are key ideas in marriage. The celibate priest is in a very good position to counsel people on how to keep the marital vows such as fidelity as they have experience of keeping the much stricter vow of celibacy."}
{"id": 1677, "content": "The Catholic church should not bend its principles for the sake of expediency. Many more issues divide Roman Catholicism from other churches (e.g. the authority of the Pope, the nature of the sacrament, even the wording of the creed). If the church accepted this change for the sake of convenience, where would it stop? Should women also be allowed to become priests? More likely such a compromise would see a further split in the church, as those who upheld traditional Catholic teaching rejected the change. Look how the Episcopal (Anglican) church is falling apart over the ordination of gay priests and women bishops, including some bishops leaving the Anglican for Catholic Church. That would hardly be a healthy development for the unity of the church or for the authority of the priesthood."}
{"id": 1678, "content": "It is key to this debate that school children are required to recite the Pledge of Allegiance at the start of each day. Although they have the opportunity to opt out, the proposition does not believe they have the knowledge necessary to fully understand the oath that they are taking. Just as in Lee , the policy and the Act place students in the untenable position of choosing between participating in an exercise with religious content or protesting. \"(United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, 2002) Children should not be put in this position so ‘under God’ must be taken out."}
{"id": 1679, "content": "After nearly sixty years of having the words “under God” included in the Pledge of Allegiance this legislation will not be seen as a move to neutrality but a move against religion. Any modification to the Pledge of Allegiance will be seen as a wilful act by the current government; true neutrality can only be shown by maintaining the status quo."}
{"id": 1680, "content": "Sexuality is an indivisible part of personhood; people need to be able to express their sexuality openly in order to fully actualise themselves. It is wrong therefore to use sexuality as an individual metric by which they are eligible to become priests or not – they should be taken on the whole of their personhood."}
{"id": 1681, "content": "The Church has adapted over the centuries on a number of social and natural issues as it seeks to re-interpret and re-explain God’s message of love in the terms of modern society. For example Churches have adapted to the problems that science has thrown up, even the Catholic church, often the slowest to embrace change did eventually agree with Galileo over the earth going round the sun. There will be others in the future."}
{"id": 1682, "content": "Ordination is a privilege of service granted to men deemed mature enough in all aspects of their lives to be able to be faithful to that service It is Catholic doctrine that Homosexuals are incapable of perceiving human nature as God as created it, consisting of male and female persons meant for mutual attraction, complementarity, and, God-willing, marriage and children. Instead, they see members of their own gender as mutually attractive in a sexual sense. They do not see females as such. In other words, they do not see or experience objective reality. Since this is so, it follows that homosexual priests possess a serious handicap which makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to serve well as ordained ministers."}
{"id": 1683, "content": "The vast popularity of MOOCs can be explained by the fact that people are finding it easier to learn this way. The best feature of online learning that it can be done in the privacy of one's home, which is more convenient than having to move cities or even countries for a university degree. Moreover, online courses are inherently more flexible. Lectures can be watched and tests taken at any time a person desires (within the deadlines), unlike with scheduled lectures and tests at the traditional university. Not only this means a more personal approach to studying, it also provides people with more flexibility to manage their other commitments, such as work and childcare. Such personal and flexible approach to learning will overtake the rigidity of the traditional university."}
{"id": 1684, "content": "With online courses, unlike with actual tests and lectures, there is no way to ensure the person is not cheating on the other side of the screen. There is no way to ensure that essays and papers are written by people who will be getting degrees, and especially that tests and examinations are taken by the people who will be getting the degrees. But even if they are the same people, there is no way to prevent cheating during tests and examinations, as people can just have the cheat sheets in front of them and there are no supervisors to stop them from doing so. The crucial point about university degrees is that they ensure that the person is the professional. With online courses, that is not possible, which undermines the whole idea of the university degree."}
{"id": 1685, "content": "Online courses impair live communication between students and professors and among students. For instance, Coursera professors ask students not to email them because due to high numbers of students taking the course meaning they cannot reply . Moreover, due to pre-recorded lectures, there is no option of asking professors questions. There are no live class discussions. Sure students could email each other, but it is more difficult to freely communicate with people you do not know and never met. It is also difficult to imagine that, given their numbers, students could get personal feedback on their progress from professors themselves, and not, say, teaching assistants (as Coursera does) or even from computers. Lack of personal feedback and engagement with professors and other students in discussions of the material decreases the quality of education."}
{"id": 1686, "content": "For many students leaving for a university is a passage to an independent life, as they often move out out of their parents’ home and even their countries. This means they have to start learning or practically using lots of skills of independent adults, such as financial management, cooking, being crime-aware, networking, and solving communication problems on their own. With online courses students do not leave homes, and essentially do not start using these skills. This takes away an important practice in being an independent adult before the real life, which might leave students less equipped for the real life."}
{"id": 1687, "content": "In order to sustain development and growth nations need to build domestic resource mobilisation capacities - through collecting tax and savings. Domestic resource mobilisation enables the transition into a capitalist mode of production - poverty can be targeted and sufficient economies built. Social and economic facilities can be provided. To meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and enhance performance capacity African nation-states need to improve the amount of funding they raise through taxes . In order for development to be assisted, international donors and intervention needs to focus on encouraging innovative models of taxation such as taxing mobile phones. Such taxes don’t have the track record of failure other taxes have providing a new opportunity to redesign the taxation system. Initiatives such as the mobile phone tax provide a trial for such a new model helping to gain support for future changes."}
{"id": 1688, "content": "The model is for rolling out a tax for all, on a commodity used by all. The cost is small and fair, only applying to individuals who are able to afford to buy and use a working mobile phone. Those who can afford multiple phones will be hit harder so this is a progressive tax. Arguments suggesting the tax cost is unreasonable fails to look at the politics constructing such a discourse and manipulating what collected tax can do. Motivations for opposition are not necessarily emerging out of concern for individuals’ well-being, but rather have alternative motives. The MOAT (Mobile Operators Association of Tanzania) oppose the tax fearing profit margins may decline; and politicians may use fear over the new tax policy to gain political support for oppositional parties. The opposition of the operators however merely reaffirms that it is a fair tax and those who would support opposition to the measure can be won round through explaining this."}
{"id": 1689, "content": "Tax evasion remains a key concern across Tanzania. There remains a low tax base and high evasion. Imposing a quick-fix solution by taxing mobile phones fails to solve underlying issues. The model is widening the base of taxation, whilst neglecting the issue of tax evasion. Therefore, to what extent will the model provide future benefits? Domestic resource policies need to ensure the taxation enables state-building and future capacities to impose tax more effectively and equally. The model relied on MOAT to collect taxes monthly, reducing the need for the TRA to construct a functioning tax-collection system or resolve social resistance to taxation. This then is effectively privatising a vital state function."}
{"id": 1690, "content": "The difference between us and other animals is a matter of degree rather than type . Their bodies resemble ours, as do their ways of conveying meaning. They recoil from pain, appear to express fear of a tormentor, and appear to take pleasure in activities; a point clear to anyone who has observed a pet dog on hearing the word “walk”. We believe other people experience feelings like us because they are like us in appearance and behaviour. An animal sharing our anatomical, physiological, and behavioural characteristics is surely likely to have feelings like us. If people have a right to not be harmed, we must ask ourselves what makes animals different? If animals feel what we feel, and suffer like us, to condemn one to testing because of them being of a different species is similar to racism or sexism."}
{"id": 1691, "content": "The point of animal research is that animals are harmed. Even if they don’t suffer in the experiment, almost all are killed afterwards. With 115 million animals used a year this is a big problem. Releasing medical research animals in to the wild would be dangerous for them, and they would not be usable as pets. The only solution is that they are wild from birth. It is obvious that it’s not in the interest of animals to be killed or harmed. Research should be banned in order to prevent the deaths of millions of animals."}
{"id": 1692, "content": "We don’t know how we will be able to develop new drugs without animal testing until we end it. We now know how most chemicals work, and computer simulations of chemicals are very good. Even skin left over from surgery can be experiment on, and being human, is more useful. The fact that animal research was needed in the past isn’t a good excuse any more. We still have all the advancements from animal testing in the past, but it’s no longer needed."}
{"id": 1693, "content": "It’s possible to think of people that can’t suffer, like those in a persistent vegetative state, or with significant intellectual disabilities. We could go for one of three options. Either we could experiment on animals, but not such people, which is morally not consistent. We could allow both, but do we want to do painful medical research on the disabled? Or, we could do neither."}
{"id": 1694, "content": "Humans have large brains, form social groups, communicate and are generally worthy of moral consideration. We also are aware of ourselves and of the nature of death. Some animals have some of these characteristics but not all so should not have the same rights. In harming animals to benefit humans, we enter in to a good moral trade-off to create a greater good."}
{"id": 1695, "content": "The real benefit of animal testing is making totally new drugs, which is about a quarter of them. After non-animal and then animal tests, it will be tested on humans. The reason why the risk is low (but not non-existent) for these brave volunteers, is because of the animal tests. These new chemicals are the ones most likely to produce improvements to people’s lives, because they are new. You couldn’t do research on these new drugs without either animal testing or putting humans at a much higher risk."}
{"id": 1696, "content": "Animals used in research generally don’t suffer. While they may be in pain, they are generally given pain killers, and when they are put down this is done humanely. These animals live better lives than they would in the wild. As long as animals are treated well there shouldn’t be a moral objection to animal research. This is exactly the same as with raising animals that will be used for meat."}
{"id": 1697, "content": "Mobile phones mean we are never out of contact with our friends, parents, guardians, or if necessary our school. They provide a way we can quickly contact someone if we are in trouble or are lost. Mobiles are most clearly helpful if caught in a large scale disaster such as a flood or earthquake as we can tell rescuers where we are. But they are also helpful for every day security. With a mobile phone parents know where we are and can be quickly contacted if we feel unsafe somewhere."}
{"id": 1698, "content": "Mobile communication is very useful and its main use is not to keep us safe but to make life easier. It is clearly useful that we can phone to ask to be picked up rather than always having to set a meeting time in advance. It is equally useful that a mobile phone can tell us if it is likely to rain, or if the train is late. We don’t need this information, but it certainly is helpful, and it is just as helpful for children as for adults."}
{"id": 1699, "content": "Mobile phones bring us increased independence. Being able to use a mobile phone is clearly a basic skill to allow children to be independent. It means that they are not dependent on an adult being with them for parents to know where they are. The main reason for parents being unwilling to let children out on their own is fear for their safety. This is a fear that mobiles help prevent. This increased independence has other benefits, such as teaching us to be responsible for ourselves."}
{"id": 1700, "content": "Mobile phones can easily distract us. They can be a particular problem in schools where they discourage us and those around us from working. Using a mobile phone while doing a piece of work will reduce your concentration making it more likely you will make mistakes. Mobile phones, like video games, are also a distraction from doing other things. We don’t just use phones for communication but also for games. Most young people spend well over an hour on their mobiles. As a result there is much less time for other activities."}
{"id": 1701, "content": "Mobile phones are a part of a desire to keep up with fashion and friends. We all want the biggest and the best. Mobile phone companies know this and regularly bring out flashy new models that are immediately the one everyone must have. The more children have mobiles the more are caught up in this fashion. Our compulsion to want new things all the time is not good for us. Mobile phones, as with many other electronics, are damaging to the environment. Since we buy them and often dispose of the phone only a couple of years later they pile up in gigantic rubbish dumps. Mobile phones are clearly a luxury not something that everyone should have, and we certainly should not keep buying new ones."}
{"id": 1702, "content": "There are simply no good scientific reasons to send a manned flight to the moon. The desire to do so may have good justification in science fiction but not science fact . This research is simply not related to the reality of modern cosmology, it will tell us nothing about how the universe works or, frankly, anything we don’t even know already or could find out through unmanned missions. The idea that there is serious research to be done is simply untrue. Cosmology is being conducted at the edge of the universe and the beginning of time. It’s not about collecting moon rocks."}
{"id": 1703, "content": "Whichever argument you pursue for going to the moon there are better and cheaper ways to achieve those designated goals. Whether it’s scientific, business-related, or as a ‘practice’ for exploration of deep space, there are better ways of spending the money and deploying the scientists, engineers and technicians. To waste not only the money but, more importantly, the time and expertise in the name of extending a national mythology or a political ego-fix is absurd. The cost of a moon landing, let alone an extended colonization, is foolish when there are other projects in all of those fields that are crying out for public funding."}
{"id": 1704, "content": "Cell phones in cars, unlike a variety of other distractions, can be regulated easily. They are an object which can easily be identified, and with phone bills it is possible to find out if a person is lying when they are caught for using cell phones in cars. As such the fact that other distractions exist, even if they are as harmful as cellphones, is no reason to not to ban their use. Further, other sources of potential distraction, such as passengers or car radios, may provide a net gain in utility to road users and other stakeholders in mass transit systems. Being able to carry multiple people in cars for example helps society through a reduction in carbon emissions as well as simply through a reduction in traffic. To take this argument further, there are many people who cannot drive but require use of cars. For example, children might require their parents to drive them to school. Car radios are somewhat more controversial and principally if they prove to be as bad a distraction as a mobile phone then proposition would have no problem with banning them. However, things such as news and traffic updates are probably more useful to a driver than the use of mobile phones. Whilst they may be distracting, given the huge benefit they cause for society it is legitimate for them to be allowed. Even if the benefit that they confer is the same as that of phones however, it is legitimate within our mechanism that we would ban them as well if required."}
{"id": 1705, "content": "The state places rules upon its citizens for the overall betterment of society. However, whenever possible the state also affords citizens liberty. This is the case because the state sees that when people are free to do what they want they are able to make better decisions for themselves and further are able to interact with the state better. They do this because they feel that the state is allowing them to make their own decisions and as such the state is showing its trust in its citizens. This bond of trust between the state and the citizens as well as the state giving the citizens their own responsibilities means that citizens respect the state for the fact that it does not limit them. To examine this from a point of view that does not rely on moral consequentialism and a utility based principle, it is possible to say that the state should afford people liberty and freedom because the starting point of any rational moral calculus should be the admission that an individual is the best judge of what is in his own interest. To not give people choice is ultimately an idea that dehumanises people. As such, the only time where freedoms should truly be restricted is when allowing the freedom results in a greater level of dehumanisation among the people. So for example, we prevent murder because allowing people to kill one another results in allowing some people to entirely remove other people’s ability to choose on purpose."}

In any case, the widespread introduction of speed cameras in many countries, and an increased public fear of violent crime have led to the redeployment of the traffic police who would be needed to enforce such laws."}

Effectively there is no difference between talking to someone on a hands-free mobile, and holding a conversation with a passenger next to you; in fact, the latter is more dangerous as you may be tempted to turn your head to directly address the passenger. Further, allowing the use of hands free sets has been shown to reduce fatalities, especially in adverse weather conditions through drivers being able to report their status to their loved ones and the local authorities should things become too difficult for them to handle."}
{"id": 1708, "content": "We live in a free society, and accept that people have the right to do as they please; including exposing themselves to risk, as long as in so doing they do not harm others (Mill’s harm principle).1 To deny people the right to choose to take drugs that are still undergoing testing that, whilst they are risky, may save their lives, is a violation of this principle: in choosing to expose themselves to that risk, no-one else is harmed and indeed in the long run others may be saved as a result of the tests. Further, with the assistance of medical professionals and other support, the decision to take this risk can easily be well-informed and consensual."}
{"id": 1709, "content": "At a point when all ordinary medical avenues have been expended, and the outcome appears bleak, new treatments still undergoing trials can be seen as the last hope. People are often aware of the existence of currently experimental drugs, they are likely to research into possible cures, and indeed there may have been attempts by their doctor to get the patient onto the trial. However, not everyone who could benefit from treatment is accepted onto a clinical trial: some trials, at some stages, restrict their recruitment to, for example, patients with no complicating factors or other illnesses. It is unethical and cruel to make people live out their last days knowing that there was something that could have helped, but to which access was restricted through no fault of their own: thus, you should allow anyone with a terminal illness access to such treatments."}
{"id": 1710, "content": "If these drugs are made available, you risk giving many people false hope in the last days of their lives. People, particularly when in desperate situations, tend to overestimate a treatment’s efficacy. Given that these treatments are still undergoing the trial process, it is possible that they are ineffective, or have side-effects that outweigh any benefits. Thus, to allow such drugs and treatments to be handed out during the testing process, there is a great risk of giving people false hope. This is especially the case given the compromised role of the physician in this scenario: ordinarily, if a patient wants an experimental drug, they can have a discussion with their physician that stresses the ‘in trial’ nature of the drug, and thus the uncertainty of it working. Subsequent experiences (the inconveniences of trials; filling in forms and receiving expenses) reinforce the idea that these drugs were experimental, and that the bulk of the benefit from the trial accrues for future patients. Consequently, in that scenario it is easier for the physician to help the patient to come to terms with the end of life; to deal with this and to realise that any trial drugs give only a slim chance of improvement. In the scenario envisaged by this proposition, experimental drugs can be acquired as easily as licensed ones, and therefore there is no longer that clear distinction for the patient between ‘doing all you can’ in the ordinary sense, (trying every treatment that is known to be effective) and trying ‘one more (experimental) drug’. Therefore, the patient is less likely to be able to come to terms with their own condition, and therefore less likely to be able to deal with the emotional trauma inflicted not only upon them, but on close family and loved ones."}

This is called the “free exchange of value”, and this is the most fundamental relationship in our free market economy. Whatever the artist chooses as payment through a legal transaction, it is his/her basic right to ask this of you. The only way to make sure that he/she can actually exercise that right is by making sure you only take music from the artist through a legal transaction, i.e. Only then can we be sure that the desired free exchange of value has taken place"}
{"id": 1713, "content": "Apart from the moral reason, there is also a simple societal reason why it is wrong to download music without permission. The reason is that musicians have to eat, too. Suppose you are an up-and-coming young musician thinking about what to do with your future. You can either become a full time musician or take up a job. If you become a fulltime musician, you’ll be doing what you love. But at the same time, everyone will be downloading all your music for free, simply because they can. This means that music won’t be a good, stable source of income for you, and this means you’d rather take up a job. Since you’re not working on your music every day, your talent will be underdeveloped, and the little pieces of music you do write, for example in the weekend, are not as good as they could have been. So, downloading music without permission will lead to fewer good musicians. That’s not only bad for the musicians, but also for us: we’ll have less good music to listen to."}

You have to ask why a teacher would do this. The honest answer is that it rarely has anything to do with student learning. Even if such ‘friendships’ were entirely innocent, they would still cast enough suspicion on the teacher-student relationship to put considerable strain on the teacher’s role as educator and their ability to do the job."}
{"id": 1715, "content": "Social networking websites have proven to be particularly effective for child grooming by pedophiles . Teachers are already in a position of power and trust in the relationship with their students. Being allowed to communicate with students via facebook would greatly facilitate misconduct by a teacher who wants to start an inappropriate relationship with a student, by giving him virtually unlimited access to the students after school. In fact, many such relationships do involve some form of electronic contact1. By banning this form of communication, the law would make it harder for teachers with bad intentions to carry them through."}
{"id": 1716, "content": "It is very difficult for a child to realize that he is being groomed; they are unlikely to know the risk1. After all, a teacher is regarded as a trusted adult. But, if the child is aware that private electronic contact between teachers and students is prohibited by law, the child will immediately know the teacher is doing something he is not supposed to if he initiates private electronic contact. This will therefore act as an effective warning sign to the child and might prompt the child to tell a parent or another adult about what is going on."}
{"id": 1717, "content": "Access to a teacher’s private information and photos may lead to weakening her position as an educator. How can a teacher convincingly speak against smoking or substance abuse if students have access to pictures portraying the teacher themselves drinking or smoking ? For example, a principal from the Bronx, who had been trying to impose a strict dress code at her school, was branded a ‘hypocrite’ by her students when a risqué photo of her was found on her facebook page . And even if the teacher will be careful not to post anything inappropriate on her page, a friend or acquaintance might thereby undermining the teacher. A strict separation of personal and professional life would prevent such incidents from happening."}
{"id": 1718, "content": "Many teachers have been using social media as an extension of the classroom, some of them setting up discussion pages, or allowing students to contact them about homework or things that they did not understand in the classroom, it allows the teachers to provide extra help whenever the student needs it. This keeps students interested and makes learning fun by using a tool that they are already fond of. The enormous success of tools like ‘The Khan Academy’, which uses youtube videos to deliver lectures to kids, is proof of that . It also allows even those students who are too shy to speak out in class or ask for help, to participate3. Tools like facebook and twitter have the advantage of being ready-made platforms that lend themselves well to extending classroom discussions through groups, pages, pictures, and videos. Not all schools have access to the funding to set up such pages separately and not all teachers have the skills to create them. It would be a mistake for schools to dismiss their use and their value."}

With so much cyber bullying happening on such websites, and postings of inappropriate behaviour that may later surface to affect a student’s chances of getting into college or getting a job, it would be useful to have a teacher supervise these interactions to make sure no harm comes to the children involved."}

If a teacher were having a relationship with a student, and this law was in effect, both parties would try to conceal it from others and from the authorities. There is then a question about how the state would find out about such behaviour. Would the state be allowed to access private facebook accounts, personal computers, or internet service provider records to make sure teachers and students are not communicating with each other? That would constitute a serious intrusion and privacy violation."}

Victims of cyber bullying have even led victims to commit suicide in extreme cases . Given that both physical  damage have occurred through the use of social networking sites, such sites represent a danger to society as a whole. They have become a medium through which others express prejudice, including racism, towards groups and towards individuals . Similarly, if a particularly country has a clear religious or cultural majority, it is fair to censor those sites which seek to undermine these principles and can be damaging to a large portion of the population. If we fail to take the measures required to remove these sites, which would be achieved through censorship, the government essentially fails to act on its principles by allowing such sites to exist. The government has a duty of care to its citizens  and must ensure their safety; censoring such sites is the best way to achieve this."}

In this case, if an individual expresses abuse towards another – especially racism - they may be deemed to be outside of the boundaries or free speech and can be punished for it. This motion is simply an extension of this principle; the kinds of sites which would be banned are those which perpetuate hatred or attack other groups in society, an so already fall outside of the protection of free speech. The harms that stem from these kinds of sites outweigh any potential harm from limiting speech in a small number of cases."}
{"id": 1724, "content": "Under the status quo, states already regulate other forms of media that could be used malevolently.

The internet has many means of portraying information and opinion, including film clips and sound, and almost all the information found on television or in newspapers can be found somewhere on the internet ."}
{"id": 1725, "content": "Censoring particular material essentially blinds the public to a complete world view by asserting the patronising view that ordinary citizens simply cannot read extreme material without recognising the flaws in it. This motion assumes that those who have access to material such as religious opinion sites will be influenced by it, rather than realising that it is morally dubious and denouncing it. The best way to combat prejudice is to expose it as a farce; this cannot be done if it is automatically and unthinkingly censored. Meanwhile, it is paradoxical for a government to assert the general benefits of free speech and then act in a contradictory and hypocritical manner by banning certain areas of the Internet. Free speech should not be limited; even if it is an expression of negativity, it should be publicly debated and logically criticised, rather than hidden altogether."}

The Internet is not country-specific, but international and free. As such, no individual government should have a right to the information on it. Asserting false authority over the internet would paint the government as dictatorial and a ‘nanny state’ , demonstrating a lack of respect for its citizens by assuming that they cannot protect themselves or recognise the nature of extremist or potentially harmful sites and take the individual decision to distance themselves from such sites."}

While robots are very good at carrying out pre-designed programs and collecting data, their ability to think critically and engage in problem solving is quite limited. In order to get the most of space travel and exploration, humans must be present to add their critical thinking and physical capacity to missions. For technology to continue to develop through the space program the paradigm of exploration must be maintained. This can only be done through manned space flight."}
{"id": 1728, "content": "Many firms cannot act independently, but rather rely on the technology and systems of other firms. The complicated, and often convoluted, licensing arrangements needed by many firms to function sap resources and effort, slowing productivity and causing general economic sluggishness. In high-tech and science research firms particularly, mutual licensing pacts are needed that often slow production and advancement due to the complicated legal arrangements that must be entered into to allow firms to go about their business. For example, the recent battle over rights to computer technology between Hewlett-Packard and Oracle, which has cost both firms millions of dollars in legal fighting1. These costs are entirely mitigated in the absence of intellectual property rights, as ideas flow freely and people can go about their business without the complications of licensing. \"Oracle and Itanic: Tech's Nastiest Ever Row?\"."}
{"id": 1729, "content": "The state incurs huge costs in monitoring for intellectual property right infringement, in arresting suspected perpetrators, in imprisonment of those found guilty, even though in reality nothing was stolen but an idea that, once released to it, belonged to the public domain. The United States government, for example, projects costs of investigating intellectual property claims will cost $429 million between 2009 and 20131. Firms likewise devote great amounts of resources and effort to the development of non-duplicable products, in monitoring for infringement, and in prosecuting offenders, all of which generates huge costs and little or no return2. Furthermore, the deterrent effect to intellectual property piracy generated by all the efforts of the state and firms has proven generally minimal. This is because in many cases intellectual property rights are next to unenforceable, as the music and movie industries have learned in recent years. Only a tiny handful of perpetrators are ever caught, and though they are often punished severely in an attempt to deter future crime, it does little to stop it. Intellectual property, in many cases, simply does not work in practice; firms should move with the times and recognize they need to innovate in ways that will compensate. \"PRO-IP Act Promises Increased Focus on IP Rights and Expanded Counterfeiting Remedies\". \"Emerging Issues in Intellectual Property\"."}
{"id": 1730, "content": "An individual's idea, so long as it rests solely in his mind or is kept safely hidden, belongs to him. When he disseminates it to everyone and makes it public, it becomes part of the public domain, and belongs to anyone who can use it. If individuals or firms want to keep something a secret, like a production method, then they should keep it to themselves and be careful with how they disseminate their product. One should not, however, expect some sort of ownership to inhere in an idea one has, since no such ownership right exists1. No one can own an idea. Thus recognizing something like a property right over intangible assets is contrary to reason, since doing so gives monopoly power to individuals who may not make efficient or equitable use of their inventions or products. Physical property is a tangible asset, and thus can be protected by tangible safeguards. Ideas do not share this right to protection, because an idea, once spoken, enters the public domain and belongs to everyone. Intellectual Property: In Principle."}
{"id": 1731, "content": "Every individual deserves to profit from his creative endeavours, and this is secured through the application of intellectual property rights. When an individual mixes his labour with capital or other resources, part of him inheres in the product that arises from his effort. This is the origin of property rights. Property rights are an unquestioned mainstay of life in all developed countries, and are an essential prerequisite for stable markets to develop and function. Individuals generating ideas and using their effort to produce an intangible good, be it a new invention, piece of replicable art, etc. have a property right on those ideas and the products that arise from them. It is the effort to produce a real good, albeit an intangible one, that marks the difference between an idea in someone's head that he does not act up, and intellectual property. Developing new inventions, songs, and brands are all very intensive endeavours, taking time, energy, and often a considerable amount of financial investment. People and firms deserve as a matter of principle to benefit from the products of the effort of creation. For this reason, stealing intellectual property is the same as stealing an actual physical product. Each is a real thing, even if one can be touched while the other is intangible in a physical sense. Often the product of intellect is the source of income of an individual; the musician who is too old to play any longer, for example, may rely entirely upon revenues generated by their intellectual property rights to survive. As a matter of principle, property rights can be assigned to intangible assets like intellectual property, and in practice they are a necessity to many people's livelihood. Intellectual Property: In Principle."}
{"id": 1732, "content": "Intellectual property rights are extremely important in the efficient and equitable allocation of ideas to firms and individuals1. The ability to sell intellectual property rights allows the price mechanism to assign ownership to the firms most likely to make a profit, and that are thus most likely to produce the product most efficiently, which will benefit all consumers. Furthermore, the ability to confer intellectual property rights on others is important, as often intellectual property, like licensing and patents, can support inventors' and artists' families after they are incapacitated or die. This is no different from the fact that ownership of physical property can be conferred for the betterment of dependents and family. It is only just that intellectual property be recognized and protected by law, so that it may be efficiently and fairly sold and transferred between parties."}
{"id": 1733, "content": "Without the protection of intellectual property, artists, inventors, and innovators may develop ideas without ever releasing them to the public because they lack the ability to market them successfully, or to profit by their endeavours. After all, no one likes to see others profit by their hard work, and leaving them nothing; such is tantamount to slavery. The recognition of intellectual property rights encourages the release of ideas, inventions, and art to be released to the public, which serves to benefit society generally. Furthermore, the disclosure of ideas and inventions to the public allows firms to try to make the product better by \"inventing around\" the initial design, or by exploiting it once the term of the intellectual property right expires1. If the idea never enters the public, it might never do so, leaving society bereft of a potentially valuable asset. \"Patents Grant Freedom to Invent Around\"."}

This propensity has been demonstrated time and again and might suggest that the GM companies are not modifying the food in the interests of better health, but of better profit. This is reinforced by the nature of many of the GM modifications, including terminator seeds (infertile seed requiring a re-purchase of seed stock each season), various forms of pest and herbicide resistance potentially leading to pests (and weeds) resistant to the current crop of chemical defenses. One of the more disturbing manifestations of this is the licensing of genes that are naturally occurring and suing those who dare to grow them, even if they are there because of cross contamination by wind-blown seeds or some other mechanism. The pollution of water supplies, the continued sale of tobacco, dioxins, asbestos, and the list goes on.

In fact, given two strands of DNA, created from the same original strand, one by selective breeding and one by modern modification techniques it is impossible to tell which is which. The changes caused by selective breeding have been just as radical as current modifications. Wheat, for example, was cultivated, through selective breeding, from an almost no-yield rice-type crop into the super-crop it is today."}

Secular science is committed to only looking for natural explanations (methodological naturalism), but this only makes sense if you already know that nothing supernatural exists (ontological naturalism). If God intervenes in the natural world, then this can be investigated empirically and scientifically. Evolutionists assume that “the present is the key to the past”, otherwise known as uniformitarianism. They are attempting to reconstruct the past after the event from fragmentary evidence.

Some intellectuals from developing countries already feel a certain degree of alienation towards their national culture before leaving their own country (3). This may be a result of government policy; a lack of intellectual freedom, or because of a generally conservative culture. Thus, they experience a strong lack of intellectual belonging despite the arising economic opportunities resulting from their countries’ investments. Family ties also play a strong role in aggravating or mitigating alienation. This is why it is the young, who don’t have dependents themselves, who are often the likeliest to migrate."}

The labour market remains inadequate in providing jobs for women and youths. Women and youths reflect disproportionate numbers of those forced to adapt, and create, new livelihoods following migration. Further, migrants are returning home, retiring, and therefore with limited effect on productivity. The impact of migration is distributed unequally. In a previous study by Brown (1983) the detrimental effect of male out-migration from rural areas in Botswana was indicated. Family units were altered, changing to being predominantly female-headed households, the lack of human capital resulted in sustaining the agrarian crisis, and women were forced to cope with the burden of care.

Slums represent an increasing concern. They are often in unstable environments so are at high risk of being affected by climate change which will further increase costs unless effective strategies are implemented today. Providing safe and secure housing provides a means to tackle articulated problems.

The burden of disease is higher in slums due to inadequate sanitation, overcrowding, and a lack of ventilation. Diseases and infections - including diarrhoea, cholera, malaria, TB, and tropical diseases, remain prevalent throughout due to stagnant water and a lack of services. Research indicates higher rates of child and elderly mortality in Nairobi’s slums, in comparison to the rest of the population (Kyobutungi et al, 2008).

The consequences of investment are influenced by the actors involved. With the need for quality control adamant, greater recognition of who is investing, and for what purpose, is needed. Allowing everything to be done by private firms will often mean evictions and houses just being made so as to increase rent or to sell to those who are not long term residents. Otiso (2003) provides a case of slum upgrading in Mathare 4, which showcases the need for a tri-sector partnership - involving public, private, and voluntary actors, for upgrading to meet need and resolve shortages in housing. The question might go further; can the community fund upgrading itself, if so is it the best allocation of funding and how is payment to be kept equitable?"}
{"id": 1751, "content": "Slum dwellers need to be granted rights to occupy and security of tenure. Slum-dwellers need to be provided with opportunities to progress - recognised as right-holders, or obtain a greater income. A useful method may involve regulating the informal economy - where a large proportion of slum dwellers work - to provide minimal wages and employment conditions. Such a proposal will enable dwellers to enhance financial capital and reduce vulnerability through labour security. They will then have the money to upgrade their home. Alternatively, establishing a rental market provides an opportunity for replacing slums. A key myth within discussions on the housing problem suggests dwellers want to be homeowners and the rental market remains negative. However, renting enables flexibility to inhabitants and provides an income to landlords. Such funds can be invested within microfinance, community, schemes and individual developments to replace ‘slums’."}
{"id": 1752, "content": "Despite a feminising labour market there has been no convergence, or equalisation, in unpaid domestic and care work. Women still play key roles in working the reproductive sphere and family care; therefore labour-force participation increases the overall burden placed on women. The burden is placed on time, physical, and mental demands. We need to recognise the anxieties and burdens women face of being the bread-winner, as survival is becoming ‘feminised’ (Sassen, 2002). Additionally, women have always accounted for a significant proportion of the labour market - although their work has not been recognised. Therefore to what extent can we claim increased labour force participation is empowering when it is only just being recognised?"}
{"id": 1753, "content": "Women are a diverse group, and the feminisation of labour has incorporated a range of women of different ages, race, socioeconomic backgrounds and education. Such intersectionalities are important to recognise, as not all women are empowered and the empowerment is not equal. For example, a study by Atieno (2006) revealed female participation in the labour market was influenced by education. Human capital influenced the transition into work: who was able to access labour opportunities, and which ones. Therefore inequalities among women determine the degrees, and capability, of empowerment it is therefore not labour force participation that empowers but education."}

Therefore the provision of land titles to women will mean they are forced to pay taxes (including land tax and additional government taxes). Such a reality has major consequences for single female-headed households who represent a disproportionate number of the poor . Increased expenses will impact multiple dimensions of their livelihoods."}

Currently the members of the House of Lords consist of hereditary peers, senior members of the Church of England and those appointed by political parties. Whether or not there is an abuse of power or the outcome of the House of Lords is beside the point – its very existence in its current state is undemocratic and as such it should be reformed. It seems nonsensical that a country that lectures to the rest of the world the importance of democracy, to the point of war, should overlook such a grievance in their own society."}
{"id": 1757, "content": "Whether or not reform of the House of Lords should be a top priority in the current economic climate is debateable, let alone whether or not a coalition government would be able to initiate and drive through such measures.

{"id": 1758, "content": "PMCs are a flexible and efficient tool with which to fight 21st Century wars making them a necessity. Private contractors can be hired at short notice and used only when necessary. They can be used to carry out specific missions, to reinforce traditional troops where greater numbers are required or to protect other contractors whilst traditional troops carry out more lucrative missions. Additionally, most PMCs are non-combative but rather defensive, providing security for officials, supply trains etc. As a result they are viewed less as invaders or “the enemy” and more as peace-keepers."}
{"id": 1759, "content": "Mercenaries often arouse less hostility amongst civilians than soldiers fighting for national armies. In ethnic conflict they are perceived as less partisan. The fact that civilians to some extent do not connect mercenaries with a particular ideological cause, invasion or civil war makes them ideal for protecting safe areas and policing reconstruction projects. For example, PMC Global Risk Strategies successfully guarded the Green Zone in Baghdad, the sealed off section inhabited by coalition staff. As they are mercenaries they can be fighting for the national or local government of where their mission even if they have a different paymaster."}
{"id": 1760, "content": "Currently mercenary work as a profession is not regulated by law, which allows the corruption and lack of guaranteed quality, as well as the problems of accountability to remain problematic. Regulating PMCs encourage a safer, professionalised security sector which can be standardised and controlled. Governments would then legislate, regulate and moderate the use of such forces rather than provide them outright. PMCs today are legitimate businesses, much of their work has nothing to do with fighting and killing MPRI for example \"shipped more than $900,000,000 worth of donated food and medical supplies to the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union over a five year period”. These companies are already placing greater emphasis on having a good reputation and are increasingly transparent so many companies would welcome regulation."}
{"id": 1761, "content": "ncreased reliance on mercenaries is destabilising in the long term. It allows invaders and local governments to feel that they can get away with not providing sufficiently trained or numerous security forces because there are men on the ground. It also means that the most influential actors, large multi-national companies, no longer have to pressure governments so hard to provide security guarantees for everyone because they can buy their own. That leaves those without influence or money high and dry. This then leads to a proliferation of armed forces in the country, some working for the central government, others for local governments and some for private individuals and firms. These PMCs are hired provide security and to help create stability yet that is not where their interests lie. If the country returns to stability they are out of a job so it is in their interest to keep an unstable situation unstable to result in more work."}
{"id": 1762, "content": "Some PMCs may abuse the power they wield. Simon Mann, founder of PMCs EO and Sandline International, in a recent plot to oust President Obiang in Equatorial Guinea (BBC News, 2008) shows that even mercenary organisations considered legitimate by the British Government remain staffed by corrupt opportunists. It is highly morally questionable whether organisations with such a profound disrespect for the sovereignty of other nation states should be involved with the training of our armed forces, let alone fighting alongside them."}
{"id": 1763, "content": "If authorities have good reason to believe that there is a realistic threat of a nuclear explosion in downtown Manhattan or Tel Aviv then it is vital that as much information as possible can be gathered as quickly as possible. If that requires pain to be inflicted on an individual to save the lives of millions then it is simply practical to do so. The harm represented by the pain caused to a single individual is outweighed by the possibility that information gathered from a forceful interrogation might save thousands of lives"}
{"id": 1764, "content": "The use of force and fear in enhanced interrogation gives quick results. In the event of a bomb hidden somewhere in Manhattan, it’s vital to have information quickly. Nobody, even the most diehard proponents of enhanced interrogation, would suggest that it is pleasant or should be used on a routine basis; the point is that techniques such as waterboarding are effective and fast. Responding to terrorist threats is something that needs to be dealt with in minutes or hours. Unfortunately, it is in the nature of due process and legal procedure that they trials and questioning take place in a framework of days or weeks."}
{"id": 1765, "content": "The advantage of a complete ban on torture is that it leaves no room for doubt, no possibility for confusion, no need to apply personal judgement. Under the status quo, it is simply illegal to use force or the threat of force to solicit information from a suspect, regardless of the charge. The moment that becomes something other than a complete ban then it puts an intolerable pressure on security officials to decide when it is justified and when it is not. The experience of Abu Grahib demonstrates how the use of abusive treatment can become routine, even trivial, all too quickly. If it is acceptable to use torture to prevent mass-murder, then why not murder? If for murder than why not rape?"}
{"id": 1766, "content": "The legal ownership of guns by law-abiding citizens inevitably leads to many unnecessary and tragic deaths. Legally held guns are stolen and end up in the hands of criminals, who would have greater difficulty in obtaining such weapons if firearms were less prevalent in society. Guns also end up in the hands of children, leading to tragic accidents and terrible disasters such as the Columbine High School massacre in the U.S.A. Sometimes even normal-seeming registered gun owners appear to go mad and kill, as tragically happened at Hungerford and Dunblaine in the U.K."}
{"id": 1767, "content": "Shooting as a sport desensitises people to the lethal nature of all firearms, creating a gun culture that glamorises and legitimises unnecessary gun ownership. It remains the interest of a minority, who should not be allowed to block the interests of society as a whole in gun control. Compensation can be given to individual gun owners, gun clubs and the retail firearms trade, in recognition of their economic loss if a ban is implemented."}
{"id": 1768, "content": "There is a correlation between the laxity of a country’s gun laws and its suicide rate – not because gun owners are more depressive, but because the means of quick and effective suicide is easily to hand. As many unsuccessful suicides are later glad that they failed in their attempt, the state should discourage and restrict the ownership of something that wastes so many human lives."}
{"id": 1769, "content": "Law-abiding citizens deserve the right to protect their families in their own homes, especially if the police are judged incapable of dealing with the threat of attack. Would-be rapists and armed burglars will think twice before attempting to break into any house where the owners may keep firearms for self-defence."}
{"id": 1770, "content": "Shooting is sport enjoyed by many law-abiding people, both in gun clubs with purpose-built ranges and as a field sport. These people have the right to continue with their chosen leisure pursuit, on which they have spent large amounts of money – an investment the government would effectively be confiscating if their guns were confiscated."}
{"id": 1771, "content": "Much like the failure of the prohibition era to stop alcohol consumption, trying to restrict the use of guns that are already widely owned and prevalent in a society is an impossible task."}
{"id": 1772, "content": "That’s an indisputable fact. So that raises the question of whether that’s the best way of spending it. It is clear that money could be spent in other ways and so if this is the choice there is an opportunity cost in that decision as there is in any other. There is compelling evidence that reducing the government’s take of total GDP stimulates the economy through freeing up funds to create jobs especially in manufacturing. There is compelling evidence   that reducing the tax burden and unleashing the dynamism of the market by cutting regulation has a far greater effect than government massaging unemployment figures by expanding its own employment base. Indeed it also appears to be the case that the relatively high level of government salaries in fact just puts greater pressure on employers in the private sector to compete the resulting wage inflation has a dampening effect on the economy as a whole at a time when it can least afford it. It’s further worth noting that jobs created during a recession tend to morph into permanent positions thereby building in an ever-continuing expansion in the size of the state unless it is periodically and deliberately culled. Conversely the investment directly into the private sector creates wealth producing jobs that are paid at a level that is sustainable and is responsive to the health of the wider economy.

{"id": 1773, "content": "Governments both as a whole and in terms of individual employees have a tendency towards astonishing inefficiency, because state institutions are not subject to any meaningful competitive pressures. Indeed, many government employees earn as much or more than those in comparable jobs in the private sector, have preferential pension and benefit plans, lower hours and longer vacations. It is of course unsurprising that anyone in possession of such a job would be reluctant to give it up but also suggests a lower level of competition for keeping it. In the private sector such preferential returns would suggest that a worker would be likely to work longer hours to keep them. Equally, because senior managers are not spending their own money and rarely have their salaries indexed to efficiency and effectiveness- in a way that is automatic for most companies- there is little pressure to find cost and operational efficiencies. As a result it is usually cheaper and more effective for services to be provided by the private sector wherever possible and appropriate. Although there are some areas which must be managed by the public sector, such as elections and the criminal justice system, it is difficult to see the benefits in other areas."}
{"id": 1774, "content": "Since education is something that the state is obligated to provide, any organisation that provides education is a representative of the state, even in private education. If religious groups are allowed to run schools then this means they are acting on behalf of the state, which undermines the separation of religion and the state, which the proposition believes is inherently harmful and undermining to the concept of democracy."}
{"id": 1775, "content": "The state should not allow the education of a child to be polluted by what is tantamount to brainwashing. Amartya Sen argues “Under this system, young children are placed in the domain of singular affiliations well before they have the ability to reason about different systems of identification that may compete for their attention.”  Instead they have to learn about all religions to encourage tolerance. It is totally acceptable for children to have religious education outside of school and to brought to places of worship but school is a place of education and they should be given an education that is not tainted by trying to ensure that they grow up with a certain attitude towards their religion."}
{"id": 1776, "content": "When the government allows religion to act on its behalf, it confuses the role of the state and the role of religious groups. As it stands, religious groups do not appear to be truly answerable to the state and, therefore, it is unclear whether they or the government are the higher authority."}
{"id": 1777, "content": "Parents send their children to school so that they can be properly educated. For many parents, this education includes proper moral codes and values. Sending their child to a faith school that they know will adhere to the moral codes and values of that particular faith is one of the only ways that they can guarantee their child will be brought up with the values they consider important."}
{"id": 1778, "content": "Passing this legislation with be sending a signal to the religious groups that are running faith schools that we do not think they are capable of running schools. The state’s relationship with organised religion is already a fractured one. This legislation would cause a lot of tension between the government and religious communities within the country, as well as between the state and states which hold religion more highly."}
{"id": 1779, "content": "This legislation would send a message of no confidence in religion and would be tantamount to the government condemning religion. It is wrong for government to suggest that faith schools are divisive as “the average grade awarded by Ofsted to secondary-level faith schools for promoting community cohesion was \"substantially and significantly\" better than the average grade awarded to community schools.”  This will lead to religious people feeling undermined and insulted by their government who would be attacking their faith with no justification based upon the performance of the schools."}
{"id": 1780, "content": "Handguns are specifically worse than most other weapons. They are weapons which are both concealable and portable. Shotguns and Rifles can easily be identified from a long distance making it easier to avoid those who are carrying them or conversely for the authorities check their motives for carrying arms. Handguns, being ranged weapons (as opposed to knives), prevent people from opting to run away if they are confronted by an attacker and being concealable prevent any attempt at avoiding those carrying them. Because of these unique capabilities they make excellent weapons for gang members who wish to remain inconspicuous to avoid being searched by the police. Further, they are also uniquely useful for other criminal actors such as drug dealers who need to be able to protect themselves, but also need to appear unassuming for clients. As such, handguns, where they are freely available, are often used by most criminals for these purposes. Given  that handguns are also more likely to cause accidental injuries- as a result of incompetence or recklessness- than a knife, it seems logical that handguns cause a much larger harm to citizens in places where they are freely available.4"}
{"id": 1781, "content": "Aside from the fact that handguns are uniquely dangerous weapons, when the handgun ban was in place in DC, there was a reported decrease in crime in the area. In 1977 the year immediately following the ban the U.S. Conference of Mayors reported robberies, assaults and homicides using handguns had fallen in DC sharply. Further, in 1991 the University of Maryland published a study in the New England journal of Medicine suggesting the gun ban had saved lives in the decade before 1991, claiming that the ban had prevented 47 deaths in DC per year.5 It is theorised that the handgun ban does this because it makes other police tactics, such as stop and search, significantly more effective. If criminals wish to get the tactical advantage of power that opposition mention then they have to carry hand guns in order to do it. However, it means that if they are caught with a gun they become very easily identifiable and can easily be arrested to prevent harm coming to the populace of large. Specifically, the handgun ban means that the police have a much lower burden required in order to arrest suspects and given that a lot of the time the police have a strong idea of who the criminals are, but simply can’t pin them for arrest, such a tactical advantage helps them get dangerous people off the street."}

If larger prisons are necessary in order to keep drug users and dealers off the streets, then they are a necessary cost."}
{"id": 1783, "content": "Celebrity endorsement distracts those who normally provide information to voters. Newspapers, blogs and other online media all have limited space, and, because celebrities sell, will use that space showing who is supporting whom, rather than covering debate about a politician’s policies and ideas. Though the presence of celebrities may actually give the masses more avenue to relate to electoral processes, the fact still stands that in status quo people are more interested in the activities of their favorite celebrities which will thus blot out the candidates themselves. When voters see celebrity endorsements they are no longer thinking about how these future politicians can make an impact on their lives. In some cases the celebrity may help show the platform of policies the candidate is standing on but most of the time they are simply taking airtime from more in depth analysis. What is worse when wooing celebrities becomes important for politicians the politicians themselves have less time to formulate and articulate their policies. This is detrimental to the democratic process. People having less information than they would otherwise impairs their ability to make an informed choice about how they would like to vote. A prohibition on celebrity interference in political debate would remove this obscuring effect. All of the above adds to the depoliticisation of politics. If the celebrity endorsement continues to thrive, younger generations will disengage with the important political issues at hand. Instead of learning about the fundamental issues surrounding their country, they will be exposed to party tactics that are of no use to their political development."}

In almost every case the things we may complain about can be influenced by the government either directly as with education policy or indirectly through taxation or regulation. Voting is your one chance to show what agenda you want to government to take; do you want more regulation or less, do you want tuition fees paid by the government or individuals? Of course not everything will be contested in every election but some will be. But next time you complain about something if it actually matters find a party that wants to do something about it and vote for them."}

This could be particularly valuable when negotiating with businesses, helping to draw valuable investment into their area and overcoming bureaucratic hurdles that typically hinder development. Chambers of commerce in cities that are holding referendums believe a figurehead will provide a focal point for business relations and a single point of contact that champions the city’s interests. Acting collectively, and through the change in attitudes their higher media profile would generate, mayors would be able to draw power away from the centre once again and bring it closer to the people.

{"id": 1786, "content": "An elected mayor would have too much power, making the prospect of its misuse alarming. If the mayor has the power to choose their own cabinet of councillors, this could be as small as three members, all of whom could be sacked at will for opposing the wishes of the mayor. If the mayor has the right to delegate powers to his cabinet members, they equally have the authority to reserve all the real powers to themselves. And those councillors outside the cabinet would have little to do other than to monitor broken streetlights and the standard of refuse collection in their ward. Why would talented and ambitious people stand for council in these circumstances, and what would the absence of such people do for the council’s oversight of the mayor?"}
{"id": 1787, "content": "The value of a mayor is dependent upon that mayor having a distinct area of control. However often this area is set too small. Cities are the hubs for neighbouring towns and countryside as well as the inner city. This could then end up splitting up economic regions. Birmingham and Coventry are very close to each other but at some point in the future could potentially have different city mayors. There would then be confusion; who runs regional transport policy or the West Midlands police that affects both cities?"}
{"id": 1788, "content": "Superdelegates, as many are senators, representatives or officials in the states, often have their own reelection campaigns to secure and as a result their votes can be up for negotiation or go to which candidate will be best for their own reelection chances rather than in the best interests of the party. Presidential candidates are often prepared to make concessions to superdelegates to secure their support. There is public acknowledgement of the fact that this process takes place and the fact that they are not obliged to support the candidate designated by their state parties gives them enormous bargaining power. For example in 2008 several Democratic Representatives of Ohio formed a ‘Protect American Jobs’ pact to hold back from endorsements until a candidate addresses issues of importance to the Ohio economy.

{"id": 1790, "content": "This would ensure a more democratic discussion immediately prior to the decision making process of voting. This does not harm free expression because it is serving a specific purpose at a specific time. For instance, during times of national security or disaster certain citizen behaviour is restricted. Since there is information on public opinion in all of the other weeks of the year, this two week moratorium would solve some of the harms of published opinion polls. There would be less stifling of discussion, voters would not be subjected to possibly biased information or misused statistics at this critical time of thinking and making a wise choice. Tactical voting is likely to be used less, and minority voices are not as likely to be overshadowed by popularly “claimed” opinions. Therefore, we propose that opinion polls not be published 2 weeks prior to an election."}

However, some citizens might turn to astrology or tarot cards to decide their vote. Others may consider a candidate’s religion or appearance. Many decide based upon the opinion of respected others. However much one might personally dislike some of these criteria, every citizen has a right to determine the basis of her/his vote. Therefore opinion polls are a legitimate choice to provide."}
{"id": 1792, "content": "They provide important information about what people think of their performance during the election process. Politicians have the right to change tactics if need be and opinion polls often provide voter feedback about how a candidate is perceived. Informed candidates can better speak to voter concerns, thus increasing dialogue prior to elections. Candidates who speak more specifically to issues develop a better public trust as well as commitment regarding their future performance to which they can be held accountable.

True merit should define the ability to attend university, not the accident of birth.

{"id": 1796, "content": "The system of paying for universal healthcare, education, pensions, etc. The cost of paying for free university education is ruinously high. It seems fair that all states should offer access to their citizens to primary and secondary education opportunities. University, on the other hand, is not essential to life in the same way. People can be functional and responsible citizens without it. For this reason, the state must consider university in the same way it does any non­essential service; people may pay for it if they wish to partake, but it is not an entitlement owed by the state."}
{"id": 1797, "content": "The state funds essential services, but higher education is not such a service. The specific subset free university education tends to benefit not the disadvantaged, but rather the middle and upper classes who would have paid fees, but are now relieved of this burden. This pattern has been seen in Ireland where poorer communities still view higher education as something for the rich even though it is free. These groups continue to enter the workforce in similar numbers as they had before the ending of fees, and they still tend to prefer trade schools to universities if they do seek qualifications beyond the secondary level."}
{"id": 1798, "content": "When the state has control of the purse strings, it wields a great deal of power over universities. In the case of Ireland, for example, the government has so much influence over higher education that it altered the governing structures of the major universities in 2000 through legislation and has representation on the Boards of each university. This degree of control is negative to the academic independence of universities.1 Universities operate best when they are independent of outside control and agendas. For the sake of free scholarship, free university education should not be instituted."}
{"id": 1799, "content": "It does tremendous damage to the public perception of a given political position to see the holder of that position on trial for criminal acts. Politicians are important role models for the populace at large, and shining light on everyone one of their misdeeds is not conducive to them playing such a role. This hurts the ability of their successors who, though completely innocent, are stepping into an institution now tainted with the image of corruption or scandal. Finally, the very process of prosecution can be damaging to the country, as citizens on opposing sides of the political spectrum disagree over the legitimacy of charges. These effects all deal real damage to the political institutions necessary for the functioning of the state."}
{"id": 1800, "content": "As noted above, the political life is steeped in difficult decisions, and some of these are bound to result in choices that are at least potentially illegal. The ability to prosecute politicians incentivizes political opponents to search out past actions by said politicians so as to immobilize them politically. Such prosecutions are therefore not motivated by concern for justice, nor are they conducive to a well-functioning, multipartisan political system wherein representatives seek to work together to achieve their political ends. In the most extreme cases, powerful politicians use prosecutions to immobilize their political opponents."}
{"id": 1801, "content": "It is impossible to overstate the power that the threat of prosecution has to stay the hand of anyone, including a politician, from transgressing the laws of the state. In fact, we need more aggressive prosecution of politicians. Not a single person has been prosecuted for approval illegal torture or wiretapping. These are illegal actions actually happening which the populace, with only the blunt instrument of voting for or against a politician on the sum total of their policies, is unable to effectively influence.

It is unjust that certain offenders would avoid retribution, and certain victims would be denied their day in court, simply because of a factor external to the commission of the crime. Even if the crime is not external to the criminal’s political role, the foundation of a free and fair justice system is that all individuals are treated alike, regardless of perceived importance.

The best way to ensure equal treatment of the Catholics in Ireland is to unite majority Protestant Northern Ireland with Catholic majority Republic of Ireland, where they will be better represented in politics and not stigmatized by their neighbors."}

In a recent survey conducted by The Northern Ireland Life and Times  it transpired that,  “Overall, 73 per cent believe the long-term policy for the North should be maintaining the union, with 58 per cent supporting devolution and 15 per cent in favour of direct rule. Just 16 per cent want a united Ireland, with 3 per favoring an independent Northern Ireland.”  This is not just amongst the Protestant population."}
{"id": 1809, "content": "Whilst the freedom of association exists under the state and it is true that people should be allowed to communicate with one another and form groups to forward their personal and political interests, it is not true that the freedom of association automatically grants access to the decision making process. Unions in this instance are problematic because whilst other groups do not have access to special privileges, unions are able to exert a significant and disproportionate amount of influence over the political process through the use of collective bargaining mechanisms. This argument applies to private unions as well, although to a lesser extent, and the banning of collective bargaining for private unions would be principally sound. In the case of unions in the private sector they can cause large amounts of disruption which has a large knock on impact on the economy giving leverage over politicians for whom the economy and jobs are always important issues. For example unions in transport in the private sector are just as disruptive as in the public sector. Even more minor businesses can be significant due to being in supply or logistics chains that are vital for important parts of the economy.1 The access to the decision making process that unions are granted goes above and beyond the rights that we award to all other groups and as such this right, if it can be called one at all, can easily be taken away as it is the removal of an inequality within our system. Further, even if collective bargaining were to be considered a “right,” the government can curtail the rights of individuals and groups of people should it feel the harm to all of society is great enough. We see this with the limits that we put on free speech such that we may prevent the incitement of racial hatred.2"}
{"id": 1810, "content": "The bargain between normal unions and private enterprise involves all parties being brought to the table and talking about the issues that they might have. However, the public sector represents the benefits of taxpayers, the politicians and the unions. The power that unions exercises means that negotiations can happen without the consent or involvement of  the public sector’s stakeholders, the public. Even though power in a democracy is usually devolved to the politicians for this purpose, given the highly politicised nature of union negotiations, government office-holders who supervise union negotiations may act inconsistently with the mandate that the electorate have given them. This is because public unions often command a very large block of voters and can threaten politicians with this block of voters readily. This is not the same as a private business where officials aren’t elected by their workers. As such, collective bargaining rights for public union undermine the ability of taxpayers to dictate where their money is being spent significantly.1"}
{"id": 1811, "content": "Collective bargaining is needed by people in any job. Within any firm there exist feedback structures that enable workers to communicate with managers and executive decision makers. However, there are some issues which affect workers significantly, but run against the principles of profit, or in this case the overall public good that the state seeks to serve. In this situation, a collection of workers are required. This is primarily because if suggested changes go against public interest then a single worker requesting such a change is likely to be rejected. However, it is the indirect benefit to public interest through a workforce that is treated better that must also be considered. But indirect benefit can only truly occur if there are a large number of workers where said indirect benefit can accrue. Specifically, indirect benefit includes the happiness of the workforce and thus the creation of a harder working workforce, as well as the prevention of brain drain of the workforce to other professions. When a single person is unhappy for example, the effect is minimal, however if this effect can be proved for a large number of people then an adjustment must be made. In order for these ideas to be expressed, workers can either engage in a collective bargaining process with their employer, or take more drastic action such as strikes or protests to raise awareness of the problem. Given that the alternate option is vastly more disruptive, it seems prudent to allow people to do collectively bargain.1"}
{"id": 1812, "content": "Many public industries exist as public industries because they are natural monopolies. For example, rail travel, which is often public in Western Liberal democracies, is a sector in which it makes no sense to build multiple railway lines across the country, each for a different company, when one would simply be more efficient. A similar case can be made for things such as public utilities. As such, these sectors often only have a single, often public company working in that sector. In the case where there is a monopolist, the workers in the sector often have no other employers that they can reasonably find that require their skills, so for example, teachers are very well qualified to teach, however, are possibly not as qualified to deal with other areas and as such will find difficulty moving to another profession. As such, the monopolist in this area has the power to set wages without losing a significant number of employees. Further, in many of these industries strike action will not be used, for example because teachers have a vocational, almost fiduciary relationship with their students and don’t wish to see them lose out due to a strike.1"}
{"id": 1813, "content": "Collective bargaining is a right. If the state allows freedom of association, individuals will gather together and exchange their ideas and views as a natural consequence of this freedom. Further, free association and free expression allows groups to then select a representative to express their ideas in a way that the individuals in the group might not be able to. In preventing people from using this part of their right to assembly, we weaken the entire concept of the right to assembly. The point of the right to assembly is to allow the best possible representation for individuals. When a group of individuals are prevented from enjoying this right then it leads to those individuals feeling isolated from the rest of society who are able to enjoy this right. This is particularly problematic in the case of public sector workers as the state that is isolating them also happens to be their employer. This hurts the way that people in the public sector view the state that ideally is meant to represent them above all as they actively contribute to the well being of the state.1"}

Uncertainty as to the fate of loved ones, the identity of informants or the motives for certain actions can maintain the grip of a conflict over the minds of its victims for many years . The unreason and capriciousness of certain actions can undermine an individual’s identity and capacity to trust. A victory is supposed to bring rapprochement, reason and stability to a conflict zone – but it is unable to have this effect on individuals without some method of rationalising a conflict . This result can only ever be achieved with the cooperation of those responsible; the individuals who had access to relevant documents or even participated in violent acts . Without this collective revelation of grief and guilt, the families of the victims will never know the truth about their suffering, and so will not be able to mourn them with dignity. The nation must also confront its past so that those who did not commit violence themselves, but who supported violent groups or repressive regimes, even if only passively, can no longer claim, \"I did not know\" but must acknowledge their part too and commit themselves to building a better society."}

Polls show that different races are more polarised after its work, rather than less . As the journalist Peter Storey comments, “some have decried the absence of repentance in many amnesty applications . Apart from the fact that this is a further damning judgment on perpetrators, the legislation does not require repentance, only the truth.” Storey notes that “The issue of amnesty has been… controversial. Some victims’ families challenged these provisions in South Africa’s highest court The South African Reconciliation Commission also promised financial redress for victims and their families, but this has largely failed to appear."}
{"id": 1816, "content": "Many able, idealistic and talented individuals are discouraged or excluded from participating in the political process by aggressive negative campaigning . Bright potential candidates may be concerned about intrusion by political opponents into their private lives or backgrounds . They may be opposed in principle to participating in a political culture that obliges aspirant office holders to engage in smear- and fear-lead campaigning. Under the status quo, only those able to stomach the confrontational and bullying tactics that have grown up around contemporary electioneering will dare enter the political arena. Moreover, such trends in political culture favour candidates with close links to the media. Individuals able to command the ear of newspaper owners, or who possess a professional background in journalism or publicity will be better able to manipulate or evade attacks launched via television and mass communications. A democratic system is best served when it encourages the participation of candidates from a range of backgrounds and professional fields. The ability of a government to arrive at novel solutions to problems confronting a state, to understand that state’s economy and to effectively represent different sectors of the population will be compromised without a diverse skillset within the state’s legislative and executive branches. By transforming politics into a game based on the production of political “brands” and unassailable, manufactured “personalities,” the jousting and muckraking of negative campaigning gives a disproportionate advantage to former editors and PR men . This dilutes the pool of professionals from which future leaders are drawn, leading to poor policy making (due to a lack of professional skills) and a conservative, sclerotic, defensive approach to political problem solving. Western liberal politics is increasingly discussed only in terms of communication, image, rhetoric and appearance , rather than the technical language of law, economics and diplomacy. Negative campaigning artificially limits the types of people and professions who can engage in political discourse, infantilising and disabling politics itself."}
{"id": 1817, "content": "Information on demographics, on taxation rates, on the state’s finances are made publically available precisely so that voters can arrive at reasoned, rational and nuanced decisions as to whom they should vote for. Governments are judged by evidence of the efficacy of their policies. Analysis conducted by political scientists William Riker, Michael Davis and Michael Ferrantino  show that where negative campaigning is permitted, even politicians with no history of running attack campaigns will adopt aggressive electoral tactics. If a politician wins on a positive platform- by promising to implement new policies and reform existing ones- then his chances of re-election will be affected by his success or failure in bringing about those changes. The electorate are able to test and assess a politician’s positive claims. However, if a politician campaigns on a negative platform, portraying his opponent as incompetent or his policies as damaging, an electoral victory will make such claims unassailable. The attacking politician will be free to state that his election has prevented the dire consequences he warned from coming about. Non one will be able to prove otherwise, notwithstanding the spluttering of his defeated opponent. By portraying opponents as reckless or dangerously radical, an attacking politician immediately sets himself up as the lesser of two evils. This may do little to convert undecided voters, but it still allows the successful candidate to take credit for “protecting” the electorate. Although this strategy may be the easiest to implement, it does not fit with the ideal of critical and ideological transparency that characterises contemporary liberal states. The increasing amount of information produced by governments, think tanks, universities and political parties is intended to make the state- and the electorate- more responsive to the success and failure of particular policies. By closing the gap between the proposal of a policy, its implementation and the indicators of its success, information-led democracy supposedly makes governance and democratic choice more efficient. Negative campaigning circumvents this feedback system. It distorts ideas, by misrepresenting them and rendering them unacceptable, before any objective assessment of their merits has taken place. Moreover, negative portrayals of candidates and policies, as noted above, are more likely to dominate media coverage, than the sober, balanced information produced by academics and analysts. This line of argument also leads to equally damaging distortion of the attacking candidate’s platform and proposals. By diverting resources to negative campaigning and attack adverts, candidates have less time and money to expend on the creation of positive policies. Indeed, the fewer testable claims that a candidate makes about his own policies, the less likely he is to be subject to effective criticism by opponents or the electorate if he takes up office. Negative campaigning incentivises a distant, evasive, conservative approach to government. It creates an adversarial relationship between politicians and those wishing to gather and disseminate information about the effects of policies – academics, political analysts and engaged citizens.

{"id": 1818, "content": "The content and meaning of a particular broadcast or print advert will not always be clear. A piece of campaign media may not be uniformly and objectively positive or negative in tone. Words are ambiguous, their definition based partly on the experiences and opinions of observers. Context can also play an important role in determining how a political communication may be perceived. When a scandal breaks involving an opponent, is it legitimate for one of the others candidates in an election to run positive adverts about their own background on a particular topic. If an incumbent is found to be a cuckold, for example, could a challenger run an advert asserting that he was a “good family man”? Side proposition may choose to respond by creating some variety of independent campaign commission, or by expanding the role of the judiciary. However, this does nothing to address the basic issue of subjectivity highlighted above."}

Currently, the Monarch is termed 'the defender of the Protestant faith'. She or he is required to be a member of the Church of England and is not allowed to marry a Catholic. Today societies are increasingly multi-faith, indeed, fewer than 5% of adults in the United Kingdom are practising Anglicans, and many people have no religion at all; hardly anyone believes the monarch has a spiritual right to exercise authority.

Given that ‘the average person now has to remember five passwords, five PIN numbers, two number plates, three security ID numbers and three bank account numbers just to get through everyday life’ , there is evidently a need for a single, concise form of identification. Moreover, it would help  them  to identify the people they have to interact with. There have been numerous cases of criminals posing as company officials such as gas workers in order to gain access to somebody’s home and steal from them . These identity cards would particularly help vulnerable citizens who are the most at risk of this kind of injustice. For this reason these cards should be compulsory, they would not be much use as identification if not everyone had one that could be checked by anybody."}

For example, if somebody suddenly suffered an epileptic fit, it would be much faster for medical staff to find out their illness and medical history no matter where there medical records are held as everyone’s records would be linked to their ID card , allowing them to be treated faster and more efficiently. It would also be easier to contact a friend or relative if they knew the last place where they had used their identity card, allowing faster unity of family in a medical emergency."}

As it is to be issued to everyone there will not even be the inconvenience of having to spend a long time applying for the card as it is in the government’s interest to make it as simple as possible with mobile offices taking the relevant biometrics where the people live so as to have the least impact on individual’s lives as possible."}

However, it seems unlikely that the regime has any intention of surrendering their absolute power and the people are unlikely to remove him however bad things get, North Koreans do not have access to the tools such as mobile phones and the internet that made the Arab Spring possible. As well as the security implications there is a simple issue of morality, in any other situation where the actions of a government were impoverishing a people to, quite literally, the point of starvation, the world would feel moved to act. It is as clearly in the interests of North Koreans not to starve to death by the hundreds of thousands as it is in the interests of the South not to see similar numbers irradiated by a bomb on Seoul."}
{"id": 1838, "content": "In a modern warfare scenario, the vast majority of combat takes place in civilian areas, such as cities. Whilst cluster bombs are obviously not used for peacekeeping purposes they are used in initial assaults on these areas, particularly against larger formations of enemy troops. This means that due to the indiscriminate nature of cluster bombs, in the same way as with land mines, often both military and civilian targets are encompassed in the blast radius. This is what happened in Zagreb as Martic was targeting Croat forces but the attack due to the use of cluster weapons also killed civilians. Further, cluster bombs often have a few bomblets which are duds and do not go on initial impact. The issue with bomblets is that they are often brightly coloured and when used in cities or populous areas they can often attract the attention of children who are very unlikely to know to be careful around them. This can result in significant harm to civilian populations well after the attack has been carried out. Further, due to the sheer volume of duds that cluster bombs put out, attempts to demine cluster bomb bomblets is an incredibly dangerous process that in of itself costs lives.1,2,3"}
{"id": 1839, "content": "As mentioned earlier in the opposition counter arguments, cluster bombs are incredibly effective at dealing with large formations of troops and armoured vehicles and can cause a significant amount of damage to an opposing force in a relatively small amount of time.

As such cluster bombs have a significant level of military and strategic value when used in conflict.

{"id": 1841, "content": "Landmines are merely a convenient way of providing what can be rigged in many ways – an explosion triggered when movement occurs in a particular area. Without landmines being legally available, troops will improvise landmines – they will wire up pressure plates and hand grenades and trip wires and high explosive charges, with much the same result. These will then be much more difficult to disarm as they will not have a standard design and they may also have much more explosive power. The only differences are that these weapons are less efficient, and more dangerous to the user that prepares them."}

The Oglala Sioux activist and actor, Russell Means has argued that “A libertarian society would not allow anyone to injure others by pollution because it insists on individual responsibility.” All too often the line between consumer and citizen is blurred because the interest of both state and private actors have become conjoined leaving little or no room for the individual between them.

{"id": 1846, "content": "A major problem with politics in Western Liberal Democracies is that electorates feel disengaged from the political process as they are generally presented with a choice between parties at irregular intervals without much oversight over the calibre of candidate presented to them by each party. This issue would be countered by introducing Open Primaries for candidates to elections. By making candidates from the same party compete for a party candidacy by appealing to the same group that will choose between all parties in General Elections, voters will have a chance to greater examine each prospective candidate at greater detail, allowing for a more considered choice of candidate than the binary choice made at elections."}
{"id": 1847, "content": "Political Parties are able to wield considerable power, controlling their party members and representatives, particularly in Parliamentary political systems. Through use of patronage and the threat of sanctions such as deselection, party leaders are able to manipulate representatives to fulfil their own aims rather than those of constituents. Scrutiny over the representative’s conduct would be in the hands of the voters, with reselection in an Open Primary being contingent upon the member looking after the interests of their constituents, rather than the interest of the party as is the case in many countries that do not have Open Primary systems."}
{"id": 1848, "content": "Open Primaries allows for the electorate to make a considered choice between candidate and party, with other considerations beyond the partisan being up for consideration. In safe districts, voters are given a choice between members of the same party, allowing for voters to effectively choose the next member based upon past record and views on big issues, allowing for the ideological cleavages within parties to brought under closer examination, with voters in the safe seat choosing the type of Conservatism/Liberalism/Socialism they prefer."}
{"id": 1849, "content": "Primary Elections do little more than provide a distraction to the political process. Instead of focusing on the political process for the maximum time possible between elections, politicians are constantly distracted by electioneering, not just to be re-elected but also to seek selection as their party’s candidate. This may create a dangerous precedent of politics being little more than one constant election cycle, with decision being made to please constituents in order to win two elections. We see this the most in the US House of Representatives, where decisions influencing ‘pork-barrel’ spending are made with the main aim of keeping constituents happy in order to avoid primary defeat, to the detriment of government being more disposed to dysfunction. By only hosting general elections, a clear focus is provided for candidates and electorate alike, allowing for scrutiny to be based upon the actions of politicians and the party they represent against the opposition who seek to replace them."}
{"id": 1850, "content": "Primaries tend to favour candidates that are more centrist in nature, as non-committed voters are more likely to vote for such a candidate than grass roots members of the party hosting the primary, who are much more likely to prefer a candidate who is more ideological. The dominance of centrist candidates in primaries may lead to convergence between the major parties to the extent that there is little difference between them for voters to choose from in the general election."}
{"id": 1851, "content": "Primary elections can be extremely damaging to parties as it engenders cleaves and splits which damage chances of election. Election campaigns between candidates from the same party can become feverish, particularly if the contest is close (See the Democratic Presidential Primary in 2008). This can be damaging as parties are made to spend their time focussing their energies on themselves instead of the opposition only to create an image of a divided party that alienates voters who prefer parties who can convey a coherent message about what they can provide for the future. Primaries obscure what a party is about, changing the focus from being about policy and the message of the party to the candidate with personal attributes such as image being of importance.

Many other factors promote incumbency, including the media attention a Congressmen rightly receives back home, perks of office such as large staffs and generous travel expenses, redistricting, and the ability of an incumbent to call upon an existing network of volunteers and donors to support their re-election bid. In any case, earmarks are only a tiny share of overall spending, and donations from local interest groups are usually heavily outweighed by both individual contributions and those from national organisations. Their money goes to candidates who share their ideological position and who they feel will vote to support the major legislative and budget initiatives they favour."}

There are certain acts, such as torture, to which no individual should be subjected, regardless of their own behaviour. The Geneva Convention is about universal respect for human dignity (International Committee of the Red Cross, 1949), not merely for those who show it in return. Civilised nations can and should be expected to act in a humane manner, regardless of the barbarity of their adversaries. Only by acting in such a manner can states prove the superiority of their own humanity."}
{"id": 1855, "content": "Harsh interrogation of captives has not been shown to be effective (White, 2007). Those who are prepared to die to advance their cause are unlikely to yield information, no matter how much they are threatened or tortured. Where captives do provide information, they often state simply what they think that the interrogators want to hear, rather than anything that is true (Mazzetti, 2007). In addition, given the cellular nature of many terrorist organisations, those captured often have very little useful information to begin with. Even if they have been involved in a plot, they may only have information about a very small part of that plot. Furthermore, winning the trust of prisoners can lead to more effective information than the use of torture."}
{"id": 1856, "content": "There is no moral duty to respect the dignity of terrorists. States should do whatever possible to protect their own citizens. The Geneva Convention is about reciprocity: it is in the interest of our own citizens to treat enemy combatants in a humane manner so that if our soldiers are caught they will receive similar treatment. There can be no guarantee of reciprocity from ‘terrorists’ as a whole, or even specific terrorist groups given the cellular nature of the organisations and the disparate nature of the command structures. Furthermore, terrorists specifically use poor treatment of hostages as a tool in their campaign. Given this, it is in the interests of our own citizens to use whatever means possible to fight terrorism; compliance with the Geneva Convention undermines this."}
{"id": 1857, "content": "Under the auspices of the Geneva Conventions, prisoners of war can be detained for the duration of hostilities, and are only entitled to return home at the end of the war (International Committee of the Red Cross, 1949). Given the open-ended nature of the war on terror, it is very likely that treating terrorist detainees as POWs will mean they are never released. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the Geneva Conventions protect human rights any better than existing domestic law or policy. In democracies, the accountability of elected politicians and judicial review by independent judges can instead be trusted to ensure that detainees are not abused or mistreated."}

{"id": 1859, "content": "The war must be lawfully declared by a lawful authority. This prevents inappropriate, terrorist-style chaos, and ensures that other rules of war will be observed.

{"id": 1860, "content": "War must be a last resort. The state is justified in using armed force only after it has tried all non-violent alternatives.

{"id": 1861, "content": "The war must have a reasonable chance of success. War always involves a loss of life, but expending life with no possibility of achieving a goal is unacceptable. Thus, if a fighting force cannot achieve its goal, however just, it should not proceed. Charging an enemy’s cannons on horseback or throwing troops at a pointless occupation are clearly not just actions."}
{"id": 1862, "content": "The formulation of the just war doctrine, a moral framework for the institution of war, inadvertently serves to legitimise its activities and inherent barbarity. It undermines the intuitive norm against warfare by emphasizing the ‘just’ and undercutting the ‘war’, leading to a framing of public discourse whereby anti-war campaigners can be presented and ostracized as traitors and soldiers, even of aggressor nations, heroes. In many religions war can never be legitimised for example in Buddhism “War happens. Buddhism does not deny such facts. It tries to understand how war happens. But Buddhism never accepts or legitimizes war as necessary or “just.” One naturally defends oneself when attacked. One may prevent someone from doing harm to others. Neither, however, justify harming the alleged or imagined perpetrator/aggressor.”  Bhikkhu, S. (2003, March). \"Just War\" is an oxymoron."}
{"id": 1863, "content": "The just war doctrine establishes a framework for leaders to justify the resort to force in any given situation whereby they can find ostensible evidence for all the necessary criteria. It, in other words, leaves war on the table constantly as an option; diplomatic negotiations and bargaining must succeed with the constant shadow of war looming as not only a realistic eventuality, but an eventuality that could potentially be deemed ‘just’ by either side. Any such doctrine therefore renders the resort to war as far too permissive, and encourages the false presumptions of aggressive states that their motives are not only self-serving but legitimate."}
{"id": 1864, "content": "Nuclear weapons are, by their very nature, indiscriminate and disproportional; any weapon which could not possibly be used in a responsible manner should not be permitted. Over the past fifty years, we have seen a general tendency towards limited warfare and precision weapons, allowing military objectives to be achieved with minimal loss of civilian life. The entire point of nuclear weapons, however, is their massive, indiscriminate destructive power. Their use could kill tens of thousands of civilians directly, and their catastrophic environmental after-effects would harm many more all around the world. These effects could never be morally acceptable, particularly as the basis of one’s national security strategy. They place ‘humanity and most forms of life in jeopardy of annihilation’ (Krieger, 2003). No state or leader can be entrusted, morally, with a power and responsibility that could come close to annihilating humanity."}

Corporations – along with organised religion – provide useful counter-balance to too much government power.

{"id": 1866, "content": "Forcing people into voting when they are disengaged from the politic process will exacerbate this problem; no one likes doing something simply because they have to. The election results from compulsory voting may not be a representative view of society, than the current systems. Just because people are required to vote does not mean they become more politically engaged than they were before. Rather than forcing people to vote, more should be done to engage the public in political life. Government transparency should be further encouraged as well as evaluating to what extent the current voting system causes low voter turnout. Low turnout is best cured by more education. Instead of trying to engage people by force, how about introducing political education in schools and encouraging political conversation. How about educating the public on how politics affects them? Citizenship classes should be taught to students who are approaching voting age, as it would teach the importance of the electoral process, and the history of the suffragette movement, the reform bills of the 19th century and the responsibilities of living in a democracy. The government should be trying to engage people by other means, not compulsory voting. Compulsory voting may improve low turnout but will not affect the root problem- what people actually think about politics. In essence it is just relieving the side effects without curing the disease."}
{"id": 1867, "content": "In some contexts, separation may not be a realistic option for minority peoples. However, that does not mean that self-determination is not meaningful for such groups. For indigenous peoples, self-determination may take the form of restitution for land that was stolen from them, or compensation and reparations. Furthermore, self-determination may take the form of political autonomy, or greater rights to decide how children are educated, or parallel systems of justice such as sharia courts. Self-determination is about representation and identity and choice - not about outcomes."}
{"id": 1868, "content": "Modern liberal democracy is founded on the idea that people should be free to decide their own leaders and their own futures, but not all states give their minority peoples such a right. However, this is a right guaranteed under international law. The International Court of Justice has held that this right applies not just to national governments but also people1. The two important United Nations studies on the right to self-determination set out factors of a people that give rise to possession of right to self-determination: a history of independence or self-rule in an identifiable territory, a distinct culture, and a will and capability to regain self-governance2. If these criteria are in place, such peoples should have the right to determine their own constitutional and political arrangements."}
{"id": 1869, "content": "If we accept self-determination as such an important principle that it trumps all others, this will encourage people to self-identify along nationalistic, racial or religious lines, at a time in human development when we are moving away from racist and nationalist ideologies. Nationalism is about difference, which flies in the face of the idea of the global citizen. Taken to its extremes, it encourages increased conflict, separatist terrorism. For example, the ethnic conflicts that led to the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s were fuelled by nationalist ideologies and the stressing of the differences between ethnic and religious groups that made up that country."}
{"id": 1870, "content": "Federal states tend to be larger and have different economic cycles. This allows the overall state to cope with different economic cycles by using fiscal transfers (tax) between wealthier states and poorer states to fund government programmes.1 So for example if Mississippi and New Mexico were paying for all their services themselves from their own taxes they would have debts of over 500% of GDP,2however at the beginning of the Republic it was the Southern States who were the richest due to their cotton wealth."}
{"id": 1871, "content": "Term limits are a necessary check on executive power to prevent an over mighty executive. Whereas the legislature and judiciary are composed of many competing views, with members of various parties and outlooks represented, the executive of a country speaks with a single voice. In legislatures, party leaders are not the sole sources of power, with factions and alternative nexuses of influence forming throughout that branch of government. The leader has full power over the policies of the executive branch of government. Cabinets, which form part of the executive in practice, are usually directly answerable to the leader, and ministers can be dismissed if they are uncooperative or dispute the leader’s policies. Even in parliamentary systems, leaders with a majority and a strong party whip can command the same powers as a strong president, if not more. It is thus necessary to have a check on the highly individual power that is the executive. Term limits are the best such check. Term limits allow leaders to enact their policies over a set time period and then usher them out of office. This is exactly what happened in the United Kingdom under Tony Blair where from the start cabinet government virtually disappeared Former Cabinet Secretary Lord Butler said “In the eight months I was cabinet secretary when Tony Blair was prime minister, the only decision the cabinet took was about the Millennium Dome,”  and power continued to be ever more centralized in response to terrorism.

{"id": 1872, "content": "A focus of a leader who is looking toward the next election is on getting votes. It is often the case that hard decisions need to be made by leaders, but it is difficult for them to do so when they are concerned with being re-elected. A leader has an incentive to put tough decisions off if he can retain power by doing so. When constrained by term limits, leaders must make the most of their limited time in office, resulting in greater prioritization of difficult decisions and reform. While there will always be some of this behaviour, it is curtailed by term limits, as leaders in their final term will not be beholden to as many special interests as they cannot run again. Furthermore, leaders who develop strong party structures can influence the choice of their successor, ensuring that they have a legacy. In this way term limits encourage the development of party-based systems, rather than personality based systems of government."}
{"id": 1873, "content": "With term limits, a leader will, after he enters his final permitted term of office, not have to face the electorate again, meaning he can do whatever wants, to an extent. This encourages corruption and self-enrichment on the part of leaders in their final term of office when they do not need to face the people to answer for poor management. There is likewise less incentive to follow through on election promises to supporters, since their withdrawing support can have little tangible impact on a lame duck. Furthermore, lame duck leaders can devote time to buddying up to businesses and organizations in order to get appointments to lucrative board seats after they leave office. This has often been the case in Western democracies, where former heads of state and government find themselves being offered highly profitable positions upon their retirement."}
{"id": 1874, "content": "The European Union should not be interfering with individual member’s electoral systems, it is clear that this is an area where it is up to the members to decide who can vote and when. Even when it comes to elections for the European Parliament it is up to each member to decide the form of the election within certain ground rules. It would quickly be seen as illegitimate to allow sixteen and seventeen year olds the vote in some elections and not others without a good justification. As the level of election that is most distant from the individual if there were to be a discrepancy in voting ages it should logically be the other way around with the most abstract vote being granted last."}
{"id": 1875, "content": "Elections can be confusing enough already; there are numerous levels of elections which often all are voted for on the same day so that turnout is high for all the elections. As a result voters often get numerous different ballots to fill in; the system for voting in each may well be different and are often complex. Adding that sixteen year olds can vote in one election and not the other simply adds to this complexity in polling stations meaning more mistakes are likely to be made. Lack of knowledge of voting process, increased complexity of voting process, and long ballots decrease accuracy in voting."}
{"id": 1876, "content": "The acceptance by most autocrats that there need to be elections shows the idea that legitimacy derives from the people is generally accepted. Meaning that these states are already part way to having a genuine democracy. Having regular elections, even if the outcome is preordained, means that the electorate becomes used to voting and the idea of voting to make their voice heard. In such circumstances eventually they are going to want their vote to really count. If there is a creeping process of reform eventually this will result in free and fair elections. Having any kind of elections means that there are people who are recognised as an opposition. This means that there is a viable alternative to the ruling party which can be turned to in a crisis, or can take on the leadership role when the regime is finally toppled. For example in Philippines the opposition was able to create a united opposition party in 1984 and coalesce around Corazon Aquino in the snap elections of 1985."}
{"id": 1877, "content": "Elections almost anywhere in the world mean politicians getting out and campaigning. Regardless of the legitimacy of the final election the leadership of the country will be going out and meeting voters. In many of these events individuals won’t be able to express their views but there are also likely to be protests and meetings where individuals can get their views across. This provides an opportunity for the leader to stay in touch with the people – often a problem with dictators who have been in power too long. Dictators will want to, and often believe that they are likely to win even without resort to fraud, as Marcos did in 1985. Thus for example Mugabe in the most recent elections made a bid for, and won, the youth vote by promising a direct stake in the economy,  so responding to their desire for jobs."}
{"id": 1878, "content": "In an election the people show what their policy preferences will be. Even if the government is engaging in vote rigging or voter intimidation they will still know how the people voted or wanted to vote (if they stuffed the ballot they will know how many extra votes they added) so will have some guidance as to the policies that the people wish implemented. If there are multiple different parties competing in the elections then it will be possible to tell which party platforms are the most popular and so which to take ideas from. If there are elections then there are opposition parties and independent MPs who are given much more space than they would be without elections. Being MPs gives the opposition some status and gives them a controlled setting in which to criticise the government. This provides the opposition with the chance to channel the voice of the people and encourage change from the governing party."}

{"id": 1885, "content": "The state has a responsibility to protect the lives of innocent citizens, and enacting the death penalty may save lives by reducing the rate of violent crime. The reasoning here is simple- fear of execution can play a powerful motivating role in convincing potential murderers not to carry out their acts. While the prospect of life in prison may be frightening, surely death is a more daunting prospect. Thus, the risk of execution can change the cost-benefit calculus in the mind of murderers-to be so that the act is no longer worthwhile for them1. Numerous studies support the deterrent effect of the death penalty. A 1985 study by Stephen K. Layson at the University of North Carolina showed that a single execution deters 18 murders. Another influential study, which looked at over 3,054 counties over two decades, further found support for the claim that murder rates tend to fall as executions rise2. On top of this, there are ways to make the death penalty an even more effective deterrent than it is today. For instance, reducing the wait time on death row prior to execution can dramatically increase its deterrent effect in the United States1.

These are important events in a woman’s life, and if she does not want to go through the full nine months and subsequent birth, then she should have the right to choose not to do so. There are few – if any – other cases where something with such profound consequences is forced upon a human being against her/his will. To appeal to the child’s right to life is just circular – whether a fetus has rights or not, or can really be called a ‘child’, is exactly what is at issue. Everyone agrees that children have rights and shouldn’t be killed; a fetus is not a life yet."}
{"id": 1888, "content": "Women, and in some cases girls, who have been raped should not have to suffer the additional torment of being pregnant with the product of that ordeal. To force a woman to produce a living, constant reminder of that act is unfair on both mother and child. In cases where the rape victim cannot afford or is not ready to have a child, abortion can do both the victim and the unborn baby a favor. There are cases where school students are impregnated through rape. Pregnancy itself is a constant reminder of the sexual assault they underwent and might cause emotional instability, which will affect their studies, and subsequently their future. Babies born to unready mothers are likely to be neglected or would not be able to enjoy what other children have, be it due to financial reasons or the unwillingness of the mothers to bring up the \"unwanted children\"."}
{"id": 1889, "content": "Every life presents an inherent value to society. Every individual has the potential to contribute in one way or another, and taking the child's life before it has even had a chance to experience and contribute to the world undermines that potential. Even more, the underlying philosophical claim behind abortion is that not every life is equally valued and if a life is 'unwanted' or 'accidental' it is not worth enough to live.

{"id": 1893, "content": "People should be free to get on with their private lives, but they can’t do that if they’re expected to also be their own government. The reason why we delegate powers to politicians is that we want to have a say in government and still be free to get on with our lives. The business of government is tremendously complex and most people just don’t care about having total control over the details of policy – they just want the power to kick out governments that are no good. Think about it: how many people actually have time, on top of all the other things they have to do, to attend weekly meetings and committees, research technical policy details to decide which policy they will support and then go out and vote on a dozen issues every week? You’ll notice that all the ancient direct democracies – like ancient Athens – were societies in which there were more slaves than citizens. It is only because the slaves did all the work that the citizens were free to spend their time playing politics. The key point is, under the status quo, people who deeply care about politics can get involved in politics – they can join a party, write to politicians, canvass for issues etc – and the people who don’t care about politics that much but still have an opinion are free to vote and then get on with their lives. But under a more direct democracy people have to choose between devoting half of their lives to politics or losing all possible influence over the curse of the decision-making. It’s not right that ordinary citizens should be forced to choose between having any say in politics and having a private life.

{"id": 1894, "content": "When confronted with chronic pain or with diseases that steadily remove our sense of self – or at least the self of whom we are aware – death has proven to be a sensible option taken by sensible people . It is a simple fact that we all die, our objections to it tend to be based on the idea that it can happen at the hands of others or at a time, or in a manner, not of our choosing. Neither of these issues arise with either assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia. Proposition has no difficulty at all with the suggestion that both procedures should be regulated and take place in safe, medically supported, environments. However, if an individual accepts that death is their preferred option in such a scenario, it is difficult to comprehend of reasons why they should not be allowed to proceed. Our social rejection of murder does not, ultimately relate to death itself but to the denial of choice. With murder someone is denying that person all their future potential so denying their freedom of choice, and this remains the case even if the murder was completely painless. Here, reason tells us, the virtuous act is death and the reservation of that choice. The determining element of humanity is that we are rational beings; a blanket ban – legal and social – on choosing the time and manner of our deaths reflects our primeval fear of a death that comes, unwanted, in the dark of the night, not the mature judgement of modern, thinking (and long-lived) humans.

Let us consider the example of the cancer patient who opts not to put herself through the agony and uncertainty of chemotherapy. In such a circumstance, we accept that a person may accept the certainty of death with grace and reason rather than chasing after a slim probability of living longer but in pain. All proposition is arguing is that this approach can also apply to other conditions, which may not be terminal in the strict sense of the world but certainly lead to the death of that person in any meaningful sense. The application of medical science to extend a life, long after life is ‘worth living’ or would be possible to live without these interventions cannot be considered a moral good for its own sake. Many find that they are facing the prospect of living out the rest of their days in physical pain or are losing their memory.

{"id": 1896, "content": "Ultimately, the decision to die is a personal one, it may affect others but, clearly it has the greatest impact on the person who decides to die. Clearly those who remain behind will have to deal with the consequences of that death and the end of their relationship with that person but, one would hope, that would be the case if she had died of natural causes at a later date. Furthermore the experience of watching someone die can by as traumatic, or more so, for the carer or loved one than it is for the individual concerned. What it clearly is not, is an issue for legislators and other strangers who have no connection to the person involved. There are deeply personal issues such as love, death, sex, and reproduction where we accept the state may have a role in the formal sense of preventing their abuse but otherwise should not have an opinion either way. With the right to die the state has maintained not only an opinion but a criminal sanction. This is a clear example of where the role of the state is to respect the individual and step back; legislation is far too cumbersome a tool with be used in circumstances as varied and complex as these. Dealing with the loss of a loved one, particularly in a situation such as assisted suicide, is painful and traumatic enough for all concerned without adding to that the additional stress of a threat of criminal sanction."}
{"id": 1897, "content": "In terms of moral absolutes, killing people is wrong sets the bar fairly low. Pretty much all societies have accepted this as a line that cannot be crossed without the explicit and specific agreement of the state which only happens in very rare circumstances such as in times of war. There is a simple reason for a blanket ban. It allows for no caveats, no misunderstandings, no fudging of the issue, and no shades of grey. Again, the reason for this approach is equally simple; anything other than such a clear cut approach will inevitably be abused . As things stand guilt in the case of murder is determined entirely on the basis that it is proven that someone took another life. Their reasons for doing so may be reflected in sentencing but the court is not required to consider whether someone was justified in killing another. It is in the nature of a court case that it happens after the event and nobody other than the murderer and the deceased know what actually took place between them. If we take shaken baby syndrome cases as an example the parent still loves the child, they have acted in the madness of a moment out of frustration. It’s still murder. Supporting a dying relative can be no less frustrating but killing them would still be murder, even where that comes after a prolonged period of coercion to fill in forms and achieve the appearance of consent. It would, however, be very hard to prove. At least with a baby we can assume consent was not given, that would not be the case here."}
{"id": 1898, "content": "It is easy to say that this social move would not lead to healthy thirty year olds walking into emergency rooms and asking to end it all because they had just broken up with their partner or been sacked. However, it’s rather difficult to see why it should not. Proposition says that all this would do is extend the right to commit suicide to those currently incapable of performing the act themselves but that isn’t so. It also extends the surety of success and of a medically painless procedure that is not available to the teenager with a razorblade or the bankrupt with a bottle of pills and another of vodka. For the sake of exactly the equality of approach, it seems only fair to do so. Proposition are attempting to pick the easy bits of the case but, by doing so, they leave contradictions in their case, why shouldn’t the right to die be universal? They know the reason; society would reject the idea out of hand, regardless of its merits. As a result they draw an arbitrary line simply because it is difficult to argue this right as a response to poverty or grief or addiction. They could argue that all of those things “might” get better. Well similarly a cure for cancer “might” be invented. The only consistent argument is either a universal ban or a universal acceptance. Anything else is an argument about where to draw the line; such approaches tend to lead to a gradual, slippery descent away from the original intentions of legislators. Whatever the initial legislation, it would likely be a matter of days before the court cases started."}
{"id": 1899, "content": "We are biologically programmed to want to preserve our species. As such, our offspring will often be more important to ourselves than our own persons. Many doctors hear parents tell them how they wish that they could “take over” their child’s terminal illness rather than have the child suffer. As crass as this might seem, they are statistically more likely to die earlier than their offspring in any event and stand to lose less. They have had the chance to experience more of a life than their child. They are furthermore the cause of the child’s existence, and owe it to the child to protect it at any cost."}
{"id": 1900, "content": "It is not fair to ask of a parent to live with the guilt of having been able to save their child and not doing so. Believing that they are guilty of their child’s death can cause Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome, which in turn is a major cause of suicides."}
{"id": 1901, "content": "We have to be able to measure quality of life relatively. There might be many cases where a relative is terminally ill, yet not dead yet. This person, with a survival prospect of maybe half a year of suffering and medication, might have a perfectly functional organ. It is sad that a person has to die, but as this is the only option , it is a good thing that several people might live when one sacrifices their life.

{"id": 1902, "content": "Many people, especially those who belong to religious groups believe that we have a duty to preserve our own lives. They would argue that suicide is never justified, even if the reasons might appear to be good. It is impossible to sacrifice your life for others, because you cannot know how important your life is to others in relation to how important other people’s lives are. Either life is invaluable and it is thus impossible to value one life higher than others, or it can be valued, but it is impossible for us to assess our life’s value in relation to others. Therefore, while we accept that some might die, it is not for the individual to take matters into his or her own hands and accelerate the process, as this decision might be made on the wrong grounds, but cannot be reversed."}
{"id": 1903, "content": "In many cases, the recipient is not in position to consent to the donation. Thus, even if it saves his or her life, it is comes with an intrusion on his or her moral integrity that he or she might value higher than survival. If we are to receive such a drastic sacrifice from someone that we love – surely we must have a right to veto it?"}
{"id": 1904, "content": "By allowing sacrificial donations society becomes vulnerable to abuse of this system. It is possible that people are scared or coerced into sacrificing their lives for others. While society does all it can for those who are ill, it cannot start moving the boundaries for when it actively takes the lives of its citizens. Even when there is no coercion, we cannot even know when a person is beyond all hope. Even in the direst situations, there are exceptional cases when people recover. However, if we take a person’s vital organs, the process is irreversible. Therefore, it is always wrong to prematurely kill another person, while the recipient is still alive and within the realm of luck and miracles. In the status quo the donor is already dead and the trade-off is not a problem, but this cannot be extended to the living"}
{"id": 1905, "content": "The purpose of society, the health sector and more specifically the doctors is to preserve health, not to be damaging health or even assisting in the ending of a life even if voluntarily. As part of this, death is sometimes something that must be affected. However, it is not in line with the purpose of medical professionals to kill a healthy person. The solution is to focus every possible effort on curing the sick person, but society cannot be complicit in killing a healthy person ."}
{"id": 1906, "content": "It is not fair to ask doctors who have committed their lives to preserving health to act as an instrument of killing a person. The doctor will then have to live with the doubt as to whether the act of assisting in the donation was just or not. In other words, if the person who wanted to die for another did not do so voluntarily, the act of killing him or her is morally wrong and the doctor becomes complicit. In order to carry out this scheme, the individual moral autonomy of doctors will be violated."}
{"id": 1907, "content": "Societies recognise the importance of parenting and the enormous responsibilities that go with it. In light of these, the parent is allowed broad discretion in determining how those responsibilities are best exercised. It seems likely that a parent in a situation such as this is likely to undertake a great deal more soul searching and thought than could be expected of an external party. This is a decision that is made in good conscience and, as things stand in most countries, within the law. Medical experts and others may well have opinions, frequently strongly held, but they are just that – opinions. The very fact that this issue has come to court, been heard and judges have reached differing decisions demonstrates that this is not an argument against fact. The opinions of parents are often supported by expert and legal authority. The parents can be expected to consider these opinions among many but must be left free to act in what they believe is the best interest of the child."}
{"id": 1908, "content": "The law is a cumbersome tool to use in matters that relate to family life; this can be seen in the reluctance to legislate too much in this area. In those areas that require massive social interaction and agreement, such as education, there is a need for legislation but even that frequently proves to be controversial and many parents take the opportunity to opt out. This is particularly true in the moral, ethical and religious education of children as it is recognised, both implicitly and explicitly that this is a matter for the family. How then is this different? That there are repercussions to the decisions individuals make regarding their religious beliefs is beyond question but we still leave them free to make them – the pacifist may go to prison but cannot be compelled to fight. The same principle applies here; decisions based on deep religious conviction are a matter for the individual or, in this case, their family. The views of the family are respected in the choice of whether to prolong the life of someone in a permanent vegetative state, regardless of medical opinion about the individual case. Many consider PVS to be “more dead than dead”. Although inverted, approaching the issue of the relationship between faith and death from the opposite angle – keeping the dead ‘alive’ rather than allowing the living to die – the same level of respect for the beliefs involved would seem to apply."}
{"id": 1909, "content": "There exists a basic right to life which, as humans, we try to follow. Killing others is outlawed because we generally believe that every person has the right to live their life and no one else has the right to take that life away. In the situation with the train there are two possible outcomes which both lead to life being cut short. Due to the fact that we place such value on life we have a duty to reduce the number of people who die. One ought to commit the act that results in the fewest deaths, and this is to kill the one and save the five."}
{"id": 1910, "content": "When any life is removed so too is the future good that life may produce; all of the good that person would have experienced as well as all of the good they could have brought to other people’s lives will no longer occur. It is difficult to say precisely how much good a person may bring. However, it is fair to assume that saving five people brings with it a greater chance of higher levels of ‘good’. Considering the fact that one does not know anything about the people on the tracks one must assume that there will be five times more ‘good’ produced by saving their lives than if the one person is saved."}
{"id": 1911, "content": "The philosopher John Rawls came up with a thought experiment to discover the right way to organize a society. When people talk about how society should be organized they generally take their own situation and interests into account. Rawls asked us to imagine a situation in which we do not know anything at all about our own lives and then try to organize society? Without knowing anything about our wealth, intelligence, personality, race, gender, religion etc., we would create the fairest society. This is because without knowing who we are we have no idea where we will be in society once it has been organized. So, in order to make sure we have the best chance to be treated fairly we create a society in which all people are treated fairly. The same experiment can be applied to the train problem. If we do not know anything about who we are in the experiment we would chose to kill the one person. This is because there is a greater chance of us being one of the five people and so killing the one person gives us the best chance to survive."}
{"id": 1912, "content": "People die in accidents and by natural cause all of the time. However, it is much rarer for a person to be actively involved in another person’s death. If one chooses to pull the lever and change the course of the train then one is actively participating in the death of the one person. The other option involves no action; it simply allows a set of events to run their course. There is, therefore, a greater responsibility involved in being actively involved in the death of another."}
{"id": 1913, "content": "It is impossible to know what any of the people involved in the situation will do with their life. One might be a serial killer while another might be a life-saving doctor. By attempting to use some sort of calculation in the scenario we are presuming that we have more knowledge than we actually do. In reality we are totally ignorant to the right course of action and doing anything in the situation could be a terrible mistake that causes a lot of pain and suffering in the future."}
{"id": 1914, "content": "While sometimes our feelings as to what is right and what is wrong are not accurate they are needed when thinking about morality. If a theory is well argued and thought out but goes against our feelings as to what is right and wrong then we will dismiss it. Most people have the feeling that killing is wrong and so to partake in any action that leads to the death of another is also wrong."}
{"id": 1915, "content": "As soon as we agree that there are situations where killing is acceptable we have reason to fear for our own safety. By accepting killing in certain situations society as a whole becomes more open to the idea. It then becomes hard to draw the line as to where killing is acceptable and where killing is unacceptable. It is much better to outlaw all instances of killing so that we have a general moral standard to follow in all situations."}
{"id": 1916, "content": "To actually be involved in the death of another person is an incredibly traumatic experience. Soldiers coming back from war often suffer from ‘post-traumatic stress disorder’ which suggests that being in a situation in which you have to take another persons life has a long lasting impact on your mental health. This is also true for people who are not directly involved in the act of killing. For instance, the people who worked on developing the atomic bomb described an incredible guilt for what they had created even though they were not involved in the decision to drop the bombs. The same traumatic experiences would likely affect the person responsible for pulling the lever."}
{"id": 1917, "content": "If we choose to save the five people just because we have the power to do so then we also have to consider all the other lives that are in our power to save. It is in our power to donate all of our excess money to charity to save lives and so we must also do this. Actions like this are worthy of praise but no one would suggest that we have a duty to do them."}
{"id": 1918, "content": "Human rights are a concept that take on different conclusions and priorities when applied in different cultural contexts. Protecting the community as a whole, by removing dangerous offenders from circulation, and by a deterrence effect, capital punishment is a manifestation of a form of “African Values” that place more emphasis on the community over the individual than western legal tradition. Capital Punishment has traditionally used for the most serious crimes such as murder as well as some serious religious offenses which it was feared might bring serious consequences for the entire community."}
{"id": 1919, "content": "Neo-functionalism is an example of a liberal theory of regional integration. Its focus is on human welfare needs, not political conflict and law. Its focus is on individuals aggregated into interest groups as the main actors in integration,  so the focus is on low politics and the areas which become integrated in the European Union reflect that. As such there has been much more progress on economic integration than there has on creating a common foreign and security policy."}
{"id": 1920, "content": "Stanley Hoffman used a Neo-Realist view of International relations to build the theory of intergovernmentalism. In a neo-realist understanding the international system is characterised by anarchy and the distribution of economic and military capabilities is of primary importance. States will not trust each other but can still reach agreement, but the agreement will be characterised by bargaining and negotiation (not an automatic process!)"}
{"id": 1921, "content": "Fundamental human rights exist and are founded on universal human needs. Certain needs are necessary to human life in every instance and circumstance. These include food, water, shelter and security of person. Human life is not possible without any one of these things, and so these needs may be termed 'fundamental rights' necessary to the continued existence of that person. Every person has a right to the fulfilment of these needs as the alternative is non-existence, which is contrary to our basic human nature to survive. Because all humans everywhere possess at birth a drive to survive and all share these requirements, they are clearly fundamental to our nature and we have a right to their fulfilment and protection."}
{"id": 1922, "content": "Many human rights are not compatible with each other. If two things are both 'fundamental' then they must both be equally true and important. However the protection of any human right requires the violation of others. For example the right to security of person requires the existence of a police force, which must be funded by taxes coercively obtained, which violates the right to property. Similarly the right of a wife to divorce her husband to protect her own happiness may compromise his own happiness. A right cannot be 'fundamental' if it must be weighed up, balanced against and possibly compromised in light of another 'fundamental' right, as this would mean they exist in conflict with each other."}
{"id": 1923, "content": "Humans are omnivores – we are meant to eat both meat and plants. Like our early ancestors we have sharp canine teeth for tearing animal flesh and digestive systems adapted to eating meat and fish as well as vegetables. Our stomachs are also adapted to eating both meat and vegetable matter. All of this means that eating meat is part of being human. Only in a few western countries are people self-indulgent enough to deny their nature and get upset about a normal human diet. We were made to eat both meat and vegetables - cutting out half of this diet will inevitably mean we lose that natural balance. Eating meat is entirely natural. Like many other species, human beings were once hunters. In the wild animals kill and are killed, often very brutally and with no idea of “rights”. As mankind has progressed over thousands of years we have largely stopped hunting wild animals. Instead we have found kinder and less wasteful ways of getting the meat in our diets through domestication. Farm animals today are descended from the animals we once hunted in the wild."}
{"id": 1924, "content": "A vegetarian or vegan diet may result in a person not getting enough iron. This is because, although you can get iron from foods such as pulses, green leafy vegetables and nuts, the iron in these foods isn't absorbed so easily. The symptoms of this feeling breathless after little exercise, feeling tired and a short attention span and poor concentration. Other conditions include frequently becoming ill, frequently becoming depressed, and malnourishment."}
{"id": 1925, "content": "In a welfare state such as the United Kingdom, everyone enjoys the same access to services provided by the government, and so it should stand to reason that everyone should also contribute equally to the funding of those services. As not all individuals are equal in their wealth and income, it is impossible to do this on the basis of everyone paying in the exact same numerical amount of money. However, this parity can be achieved by everyone paying the same percentage of their income in tax to the government, and this is exactly what a flat tax is, and so equality in contribution to government services (mirroring equality in access to government services) is achieved. This principle of equality is important for two reasons: firstly, if wealthier citizens feel they are being unfairly burdened by the current requirement that they pay higher percentages of their income to fund government services than those on lower incomes, they may feel a disincentive to work hard (which creates wealth for the whole economy), or may even be driven abroad to states with lower rates of taxation or to tax havens. Thus a flat tax is fairer as it equalized the basis on which everyone pays for access to equal services, and prevents a poorer majority from victimizing a wealthier minority through punitive rates of income tax for the wealthy, which may cause them to flee the country for other states with less taxation."}
{"id": 1926, "content": "Tax credits, deductions and loopholes distort resource allocation in a market situation because people respond to the differing tax rates and so put more resources  into the areas which the loopholes apply to than they would otherwise. For example, current tax credits for investment mean that more resources go into investment than they would in the absence of that credit, as the returns on the placing of resources in this area are higher than others (as it is subject to a lower rate of tax). A government may even set certain tax credits and loopholes which favour certain industries or economic sectors, such as agriculture, on the basis that this is politically useful (in winning votes), when this again distorts resource allocation in the economy. These distortions may prove harmful as they cause certain sectors to be over-valued or over-invested in due to their favourable tax status, to the detriment and neglect of other more highly-taxed areas (for example, manufacturing) which may in fact be the more economically sound. A flat tax would abolish all 'credits' and 'loopholes' (and the politically-influenced government discretion which decides who gets credits and who does not) and therefore restore genuine market conditions without these harmful distortions."}
{"id": 1927, "content": "Many of the so-called 'loopholes' which a flat tax would close, by ending the exemptions given when you engage in certain kinds of expenditure under the current income tax system, are actually positive features which incentivize 'good' economic behaviour. One of the great advantages from owning a home, for example, is the resulting ability to deduct mortgage interest payments from taxes. This makes owning a home more expensive, meaning a greater number of people will be able unable or unwilling to buy homes, and will thus be forced to rent instead. This harms their long-term economic prospects, as their mortgage payments would result in them eventually owning an asset whereas rent payments bring them no return, and as self-owned homes become in less demand, the value of the homes which hundreds of thousands of people have already spent decades paying mortgages for will plummet. This would also cause great harm to the construction industry as fewer people can afford to buy new houses. Another example of a useful 'loophole' is that profits and capital gains are currently taxed differently. Under a flat tax they would both be taxed equally, representing a kind of 'double taxation' which would hit most heavily new, young venture capitalists going into high-risk industries, and so will stifle investment and innovation. Finally, the current income tax deductions we allow for charitable giving would be 'closed' with a flat tax, and hence charitable giving would become less affordable and less attractive to most taxpayers."}
{"id": 1928, "content": "Suicide is a waste of life. It is an immoral act that ignores the sacrosanct nature of human life – something that is universally considered to be the case as shown by being something nearly all religions consider to be the case. Nowadays we hear everyone talking about human rights; we hear precious little about human obligations. If we believe in the moral worth of human rights we do so because we think that human life is a wonderful thing and something with which we should not interfere. Whether the interference is by others or by ourselves, any action that denigrates human life is morally wrong for precisely the reason that we support human rights. We have an obligation to preserve all life, including our own."}
{"id": 1929, "content": "Suicide is an entirely selfish act that causes immense pain and suffering for those loved ones that are left behind. It is also cowardly; rather than facing your problems and being strong, you instead take the easy way out and kill yourself. It is important, therefore, to instil a strong sense of responsibility to one’s family and for one’s affairs and to do this by punishing those who try and fail to perpetrate this selfish and cowardly act."}
{"id": 1930, "content": "Like abortion, euthanasia, cloning and genetic engineering, suicide undermines the sanctity and inviolability of the human body. It is legitimate to legislate against such actions because the sanctity of the human body is an intrinsic constituent part of the respect for human dignity, which is the sine qua non of social life in any country."}
{"id": 1931, "content": "Criminal legislation is not the vehicle for society’s pronouncements on questions of how one should live one’s life. It instead involves the entirely practical exercise of ensuring that individuals are able to live freely and enjoy their freedom without fear of external interferences like theft, violence or murder. Criminal legislation should guarantee a safe space for autonomous individual action - like suicide."}
{"id": 1932, "content": "When we speak of the right to life it means more than merely the right  to be alive , it encompasses the right to self-ownership, the notion that one’s life is one’s own and that you are not beholden to anyone else by the mere fact that you are alive. It follows from this that there can be no duty on anyone to live beyond a point of their own choosing, and there should be no attempt to interfere with suicidal behaviour whether by individuals or by the law."}
{"id": 1933, "content": "Death is an inevitable fact of life . Suicide is therefore not a matter of choosing between life and death per se, but of choosing the  time and   manner  of death one wishes. We would all prefer a painless death over a slow and agonising one, and it is better to be able to prepare oneself and if possible anyone else who will be affected, so why should the difference between the two be a matter of luck and not one of choice?"}
{"id": 1934, "content": "Whilst the rich spend proportionately less of their income than the poor, the rest of their income is often invested in other areas and financial vehicles, boosting the economy in both the short and long term. In the short term this money allows businesses to take more risks owing to a greater pool of money to offset the risk, alongside lower interest rates. In the long term, these risks often lead to innovations that help the economy overall. In increasing the tax burden on the rich, the spending and investment that wealthy individuals partake in is cut off, preventing these areas of the economy from growing. Recessions and recession prevention are often reliant upon public perception of an economy’s general health and the extent of its exposure to less stable economies. Due to this feedback mechanism, it is possible, therefore, that an unfounded belief that tax rises could obstruct economic growth might cause panic amongst the media and the populace. A recession might come about through the mere expectation that there will be a recession. In fact, given that the majority of the media is controlled by the rich, it is within their best interest to report that there will be a crisis if there is a tax increase so that they can claim the policy was at fault in the future."}
{"id": 1935, "content": "Liberty is one of the highest values human beings strive for. Liberty means that individuals ‘own’ themselves: individuals only decide for themselves what to do with their minds and bodies during their lifetime. Private property is an extension of this, because private property comes about by undertaking an activity with one’s own body or mind: when I pluck apples from a wild apple tree, they become my property through me using my own body to do the plucking. Similarly, free exchange is an extension of this, because it only comes about if both parties perceive the exchange to be beneficial to them: I will only sell the apples I plucked if I get more value in exchange than the value that continued possession of the apples gives me. Free markets are the only system of allocating goods and wealth in society that relies on these basic notions of liberty to operate. If someone becomes rich in a free market, then that came about through free exchange: this person has provided so many goods and services of value to other people, that they gave him or her great wealth in return. Compare this to the government redistributing wealth: that would require the government appropriating part of someone’s income via taxes. That income is private property. Appropriating private property, not voluntary exchange, amounts to theft, which means that taxes are a form of theft and therefore a significant harm to individual liberty. Free markets don’t harm liberty like this, which is why they are morally superior."}
{"id": 1936, "content": "A ‘common good’ is a resource which has finite but replenishable supply but which is by its nature ‘non-excludable’ (meaning it’s hard to exclude individuals from using the resource). One example is the stock of fish in the sea. If all fishermen would refrain from overfishing, the fish population would have time to restore itself. But each individual fisherman has an incentive to capture and sell as much as possible. Since in a free market, there is no government coordinating supply and demand, each fisherman acts on their individual incentives. The result is rapid, irreversible depletion of the common good ( Tragedy of the commons,  1968). A ‘public good’ is a resource which is also ‘non-excludable’ but is also ‘non-rivalrous’, that is a good whose consumption by one consumer still allows simultaneous consumption by other consumers. One example of this is the air we breathe: every breath I take does not prevent you from taking a breath, nor can I feasibly exclude you from breathing. Other examples of public goods are schools, roads and national defense. Public goods suffer from the ‘free rider’ problem: once the good is produced, no one has an incentive to pay for the good. Since the good is non-excludable, no one can prevent someone from using it. This also leads to what economists call ‘negative externalities’: industries can freely pollute the air we breathe and not bear the costs for it. The issues of climate change are a direct example of this: corporations aren’t forced to pay for the negative externality of emitting greenhouse gases, and so continue doing it."}
{"id": 1937, "content": "The free market views the human body and the human mind as a mere instrument: the only value an individual being has is the value it can sell its labour (whether it be manual or mental work) for on the market. Workers don’t work because they want to produce something they themselves find inherently valuable; they work to earn a living. And given that most people are not entrepreneurs or business owners, this means that most people will spend the most of their waking day labouring for goals set to them by others, in partial processes subdivided and defined for them by others, all to create products and services which are only valuable to others, not to themselves ( Alienation,  1977). This commodification of the human body and mind can go so far that humans actually start selling themselves: free market proponents propose to legalize the selling of one’s own organs. When humans start selling themselves, they perceive no value in themselves anymore – all they see in themselves is an instrument to satisfy other people’s desires, a product to be packaged and sold. This becomes even more pronounced when we take into account that the free market exacerbates inequality: if someone is born into a poor family and can’t get out of it, it might seem the only way to get out of it, is to sell oneself. Thus, the proposal to legalize the selling of one’s own organs amounts to an ‘unconscionable choice’: a choice which is, given the circumstances, unreasonable to ask of someone."}
{"id": 1938, "content": "Perhaps the most basic and fundamental of all our rights. However, with every right comes a choice. The right to speech does not remove the option to remain silent; the right to vote brings with it the right to abstain. In the same way, the right to choose to die is implicit in the right to life. The degree to which physical pain and psychological distress can be tolerated is different in all humans. Quality of life judgements are private and personal, thus only the sufferer can make relevant decisions. People are given a large degree of autonomy within their lives and since deciding to end your life does not physically harm anyone else, it should be within your rights to decide when you wish to die. While the act of suicide does remove option to choose life, most cases in which physician assisted suicide is reasonable, death is the inevitable and often imminent outcome for the patient regardless if by suicide or pathological process. The choice for the patient, therefore, is not to die, but to cease suffering and tto chose the time and manner of their death."}
{"id": 1939, "content": "The gradual decline of their body, the failure of their organs and the need for artificial support. In some cases, the illness will slowly destroy their minds, the essence of themselves; even if this is not the case, the huge amounts of medication required to ‘control’ their pain will often leave them in a delirious and incapable state. At least five percent of terminal pain cannot be controlled, even with the best care. Faced with this, it is surely more humane that those people be allowed to choose the manner of their own end, and have the assistance of a doctor to die with dignity. One particular account was of Sue Rodriguez who died slowly of Lou Gehrig's disease. She lived for several years with the knowledge that her muscles would, one by one, waste away until the day came when, fully conscious, she would choke to death. She begged the courts to reassure her that a doctor would be allowed to assist her in choosing the moment of death. Rodriguez did not accept the verdict and with the help of an anonymous physician committed suicide in February 1994."}
{"id": 1940, "content": "The guiding principle of medical ethics is to do no harm: a physician must not be involved in deliberately harming their patient. Without this principle, the medical profession would lose a great deal of trust; and admitting that killing is an acceptable part of a doctor’s role would likely increase the danger of involuntary euthanasia, not reduce it. Legalising assisted suicide also places an unreasonable burden on doctors. The daily decisions made in order to preserve life can be difficult enough; to require them to also carry the immense moral responsibility of deciding who can and cannot die, and the further responsibility of actually killing patients, is unacceptable. This is why the vast majority of medical professionals oppose the legalisation of assisted suicide: ending the life of a patient goes against all they stand for. The Hippocratic Oath that doctors use as a guide states 'I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody if asked for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect.'"}
{"id": 1941, "content": "Life is Sacred so no one has the right to take a life, this includes ones own. As a result both suicide and assisted suicide are wrong. There are many passages within the bible that speak of the idea that God has appointed a time for all to die, 'Hebrews 9:27, “And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgement:” Ecclesiastes 3:1-2, “To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;” Ecclesiastes 7:17, “Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?”  In addition to this, physicians are nowhere in Scripture given authority to take someone's life. Apart from the government in the case of capital punishment, all other human beings are given the commandment “Thou shalt not kill,” Exodus 20:13 and “Thou shalt do no murder,” Matthew 19:18."}
{"id": 1942, "content": "Some people who do not agree with voluntary euthanasia argue that if it was legalised, it would damage the moral and social foundation of society by removing the traditional principle that man should not kill, and reduce the respect for human life. It might also be the case that once voluntary euthanasia has been legalised, this might lead to cases of involuntary euthanasia being carried out. With people deciding that someone else's life such as the elderly or the terminally ill is not worth living and therefore performing euthanasia without their consent."}
{"id": 1943, "content": "It would be incredibly disingenuous of the opposition if they did not concede that the dangers are great and that something must be done. Because, deep down, everyone knows that it is simply a balancing of risks – in practice all the government is trying to do is save lives. It is of course, the government’s primary duty to protect citizens but this can only be done with the loss of some civil liberties. These liberties will of course still be completely protected by the courts. When it comes to the issue of life and death, it is the proposition’s hope that a few civil liberties would be only willingly given up by any prudent citizen."}
{"id": 1944, "content": "It is the aim of all terrorists to influence by violent means government policy. If we changed how our country was run we would be letting the terrorists win – they would be getting what they wanted. If we changed the way we lived , greater security measures or something else, we would be shaping our society to the tune of the terrorist. So more security measures at airports limit the freedom to travel, turning the country into a surveillance society makes everyone nervous; ultimately the country is no longer the same as it was having lost the freedoms which are the best way to combat terrorism. This is something perversely wrong."}
{"id": 1945, "content": "Although the anti-terrorist measures are supposed to be trying to catch certain people, it is the whole of the public who have to suffer on a daily basis: an abundance of security cameras, security checks, and anti-privacy measures continually invade innocent people’s lives and yet it is supposed to be the terrorists who are being punished. The issue of justice, and whether it is actually being done, has to be fully looked at properly. These measures are not solving the problem of terrorism as it does not address the core grievances. Instead other ways such as negotiation to address grievances is necessary, as happened in Northern Ireland ."}
{"id": 1946, "content": "Juries are not technically trained in evaluating evidence.1 Additionally, judges are trained to recognize and suppress their own prejudices, evaluate information given to them, recognize prosecutorial strategy etc., better allowing them to make objective decisions. Furthermore, some studies suggest that juries actually work against the innocent; a 1979 study found that \"more than 5 per cent of defendants found guilty by juries were considered by professionals to have been convicted in questionable circumstances. \"2This is hardly surprising given that jurors are ordinary citizens who are forced to sit through what are often dull and protracted trials, and who may have little interest in actually listening to what is being said (Joanne Frail, a juror convicted for contempt of court stated that she 'drew more than she wrote ').3 Perhaps we should trust in the expertise of screened and trained justices instead."}
{"id": 1947, "content": "Especially in cases of nationalist conflict or terrorist attacks, it may be extremely difficult to have a non-biased jury. In Northern Island, for example, jurors may sympathize with violent offenders and acquit them despite a preponderance of evidence. Similarly, it can be a struggle to appoint non-biased juries for terrorism trials post 9/11. In 2003, the \"Lackwana Six\" were accused of aiding a foreign terrorist organization. The magistrate noted that \"Understandably, the infamous, dastardly and tragic deeds and events of September 11, 2001 have caused a maelstrom of human emotions to ... create a human reservoir of strong emotional feelings such as fear, anxiety and hatred as well as a feeling of paranoia... These are strong emotions of a negative nature which, if not appropriately checked, cause the ability of one to properly reason to ... be blinded.\" Questions about jury impartiality have been raised in multiple similar cases, even leading some defendants to claim that they pled guilty out of resignation that the jury would inevitably be biased and refuse to acquit.1 The implication is that in some trials, juries may be unable to make impartial decisions, thus making the trial unfair. The only way for justice to be done, in such cases, is to allow a judge to decide the verdict."}
{"id": 1948, "content": "A just adversarial court system is premised on absolutes: that the defence has certain absolute rights which check it against government corruption, and which ensure fair trials even at the expense of conviction. Indeed, it is for this reason that we say it is better to let ten guilty men go free than to punish one innocent man. The protections in place that ensure fair trials must always be upheld, or else the guarantee of fairness no longer exists. If the government can sometimes remove this right, even in clearly delineated circumstances, then the right is no longer absolute, and the presumption in favour of the defence is far weaker, undermining the justness of the entire system."}
{"id": 1949, "content": "Humans are fallible, and so sometimes it is better to have absolute rules against certain actions, even if we recognize that in a perfect world, it might be better to allow such actions in very specific circumstances.1 It is for this reason, for example, that we never allow evidence obtained by illegal measures to be presented in court, even though such evidence would sometimes make it possible to convict. Similarly, even if removing trial by jury might be good in individual circumstances, it is too great a power to give to a fallible government which may misuse that authority. If there is a precedent of the right to trial by jury being removed in some circumstances, even if that removal is justified, it becomes much easier for corrupt governments to remove it for unjustified reasons, and it becomes correspondingly more difficult for us to condemn that decision as illegitimate."}
{"id": 1950, "content": "The government is here to serve the people. The concept behind a referendum is public sovereignty, the people themselves are the ones who get to decide. Having had one referendum it has already been agreed that this is an issue where it should not be up to our representatives in Parliament to decide, rather it is an issue for direct democracy. Having started the issue, the people have a right to determine the result. In Parliament there is not just a single vote on an issue. Rather there are three readings of a bill in each house. Then there is consideration of amendments from the house that did not initiate the bill often with parliamentary ping pong. Throughout this MPs get multiple opportunities to vote, both on the whole bill and on individual amendments."}
{"id": 1951, "content": "Secrecy in relation to the leader’s health shows a distrust or distain of the electorate. Not being open about health issues almost invariably means that the administration is lying to those who elected them, those who they are accountable to. A couple of days before John Atta Mills died Nii Lantey Vanderpuye a candidate for Mills’ party stated “He is stronger and healthier than any presidential candidate”, information that in retrospect was clearly untrue."}
{"id": 1952, "content": "The health and fitness of a leader is a vital issue when choosing a leader; the electorate deserves to know if they are likely to serve out their term. When health conditions are hidden from the people they may mistakenly elect a leader who is unable to serve a full term or is at times not in control of the country. There would be little point in voting for a leader who will often not truely be in charge of the country, if voters are told it becomes their choice whether this is a problem. Transparency in terms of clear, accurate and up-to-date information is necessary for the electorate to judge the fitness of a leader which is a necessary precondition for election. In a democracy a leader needs to be accountable, he can only be accountable if the elctorate knows such vital information."}
{"id": 1953, "content": "A person is most likely to survive when they have an accident, a heart attack, or some other condition if they get prompt treatment and doctors are aware of any underlying conditions. Mills may well have lived, or lived longer if there had been more transparency about his death. There had been no prior warning that the president might be rushed to hospital despite the doctors having been called in the previous day. For the same reason his outriders were not available leading to indecision over whether to send off the ambulance. And finally he was initially turned away from the emergency ward because they did not know it was the President they were being asked to treat."}
{"id": 1954, "content": "While the leader suffers from an illness, rivals can use the opportunity to ease the leader out of office. A period of illness is a period of vulnerability in which the government is less able to respond to external and internal threats. Not telling the public about the leader's health during an illness helps prevent such attempts. The same is the case with a leader's death; a few days of secrecy allows for smooth succession as the appointed successor has the time to ensure the loyalty of the government, army and other vital institutions. In 2008 when General Lansana Conte of Guinea died power should have been transferred to the president of the National Assembly Aboubacar Sompare with an election within 90 days. Instead a group of junior military officers took advantage of the quick announcement to launch a coup."}
{"id": 1955, "content": "Business and the markets prize political stability. Clearly when the leader of a country is ill this stability is damaged but the damage can be mitigated by being transparent. The markets will want to know how ill the leader is, and that the succession is secure so that they know what the future holds. Secrecy and the consequent spread of rumour is the worst option as businesses can have no idea what the future holds so cant make investment decisions that will be influenced by the political environment. Leaders do matter to the economy; they set the parameters of the business environment, the taxes, subsidies, how much bureaucracy. They also influence other areas like the price of energy, the availability of transport links etc. It has been estimated that “a one standard deviation change in leader quality leads to a growth change of 1.5 percentage points”."}
{"id": 1956, "content": "Democracies can turn into an intractable conflict between two political parties with neither side ruling in their national interest but simply using power in an attempt to defeat the other side. Bangladesh is a good example of this as there are two main parties; the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Neither are willing to talk to the other, the competition has at times been violent and attempts to create neutral caretaker governments are scotched by one side or the other as occurred at the start of 2014."}
{"id": 1957, "content": "A coup that is against an elected government that is however becoming increasingly anti democratic is justified. When an elected government is increasingly concentrating power in its own hands, and particularly if elections are postponed then it is necessary for the military to step in to ensure democracy continues to function. From 1991-2006 31 of 43 coups resulted in an election within five years so far from damaging democracy were often restoring it."}
{"id": 1958, "content": "It is never appropriate to overthrow a democratically elected government which the people have chosen. The government is legitimised by being the choice of the people, a coup is by definition not legitimate in such a way. The response to a government that has lost the trust of the electorate, unable to prevent violence, or is corrupt, is to hold an election. In the worst case and an elected government is using its power as a government to manipulate any election then the responsibility is with the judiciary to convict a government which is responsible for such a"}
{"id": 1959, "content": "If the country is in trouble is the army the best placed to take over and manage the country better than it has been in the past? This may plausibly be true if the reason democracy is failing is a large scale insurgency or near civil war but in almost every other case it is not the best institution. The army is trained to fight not to govern. The generals who take over top positions are used to running a bureaucracy that has to respond to politicians, not one that has to respond to the people. Politicians may be corrupt, venal, or unpopular but at the least they are open about what they stand for. They have a manifesto and a clear ideology which if the people don't agree with they wont be voted for. This is not the case with generals; the chances are they have a bureaucratic desire to maintain the power and funding for the military but otherwise there is likely to be little known about their politics. Finally for those who are being overthrown the electorate has had a chance to investigate their policies, their past, to question their views and catch the candidate out when they are not consistent. The candidate came through an electoral test and media grilling. When there is a coup there is no such chance to determine if the coup leader is the right man for the job."}
{"id": 1960, "content": "States are allowed to take measures for “self-defence if an armed attack occurs”."}
{"id": 1961, "content": "Within countries it is the state that ensures that conflict does not occur: the state has a monopoly on the use of force so ensures law and order. There is no such hierarchy between states. African nations, as with most other states in the world, believe in the sovereign right of states to manage their own affairs. In the same document as there is a pledge to end war “respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of each of its Member States” is reaffirmed. The AU cannot dictate to its members to ensure they avoid internal conflicts even if the AU knows a conflict is coming as those members are the stakeholders."}
{"id": 1962, "content": "By prosecuting perpetrators, justice creates a deterrent. The deterrent effect, as accepted in criminal law generally, is likely to make the peace more long standing and stable in the future – it will make those minded to perform atrocities think again. If those who committed atrocities ‘get away with it’ they will be much more likely to plunge the country back into violence. If Sharon was prosecuted for his crimes in the 50s, would he have gone on to have the same political career? He would likely not have had the chance to allow the Sabra and Shatia massacre or Operation Defensive Shield. Clearly Nkunda being locked up at some stage would have been better than regularly negotiating with him to try and create peace."}
{"id": 1963, "content": "Eritrea was responsible for instigating the war against Ethiopia, making it liable for its increased isolation. Eritrea was officially recognised by an international Claims Commission as the initiator of the war1. The state invaded the region of Badme after a long diplomatic dispute over the border issue as they believed the territory was rightfully theirs2. They removed the Ethiopian presence from the state, compromising territorial integrity and incurred a reaction from Ethiopia. This marked Eritrea as the aggressor. An aggressor in a war cannot be seen as a ‘just’ actor and has therefore contributed to its own seclusion by acting in such a manner."}
{"id": 1964, "content": "Whilst President Afewerki was fighting for Eritrean independence he became a proponent of the self-reliant state, which could sustain its own population with no external assistance. Since independence the President has rejected foreign aid to the country through claims that aid is a method of enslavement to international donors1. Numerous offers of assistance, including the free food distributions of the World Food Programme, have been rejected in favour of the domestic market2. Afewerki claims that as aid decreases, farmers will work harder to ensure that food demand is met. The lack of donors and trading partners has served to weaken Eritrea’s ties of the outside world, making the state responsible for its own isolation."}
{"id": 1965, "content": "Having oil does not just provide the money to undermine, or prevent democracy taking hold; it also provides an immense source for corruption. Oil revenues provide a revenue stream that is not dependent on the people but simply upon the global market and oil production. In a country with no checks and balances, accountability or transparency the money will inevitably go to the elite. This is how Equatorial Guinea can be rich while having most of the population in poverty. Dictator Obiang himself is worth an estimated $700million or the equivalent of about 4% of GDP. It is managed outside the country and away from political pressure. If the government is corrupt and uses the national budget to its own ends the trust fund can provide the dividends as investment in individual development projects to ensure the money is used where it is most needed. All the time it can be transparent to show when and where the government is trying to influence it or get backhanders."}
{"id": 1966, "content": "A country’s resources should be used democratically. The resources that are found under the soil belong to the nation and therefore they should be used for the benefit of the people. Even where there is private ownership extending to mineral and energy resources it is the responsibility of the owners to use those resources for the good of the nation. The only way for this to happen is if there is a democratically accountable body in charge of the funding; this has to mean a democratic parliament. Putting the money in an ‘independent fund’ is not very accountable. Even if it is independent there is no saying what the money will be used for, or that the fund is not really designed to funnel money back to a few individuals."}
{"id": 1967, "content": "When it is politicians who control both the investment and the amount funds being returned from that investment then they have an incentive to encourage more investment. They will want more exploration to find more resources, they will promote technological advances to be able to extract more from the same fields, and they will be willing to grant more production licences. If on the other hand the money goes into a trust fund then the government and parliament has little incentive to encourage the market and every incentive to hold it up. The oil only provides a risk; unpopularity due to environmental impacts without any benefit in return. The result will be that the costs of drilling will be seen in the environmental damage it causes while communities do not get any of the benefit as the money is being squirreled away ‘for the future’. This is hindering the market and so reducing the economic benefits to the country."}
{"id": 1968, "content": "Private Military Companies (PMCs) are independent, registered, corporate actors who have risen in prominence and replaced mercenaries in their security function. PMCs are different to mercenaries in the sense that mercenaries will fight for the highest bidder. PMCs on the other hand will only work for legitimate governments and intergovernmental organisations such as the UN1. Their main roles include; support services, logical support, humanitarian support and the upholding of law and order and defensive military action2. PMC activity has seen corporations operating on behalf of the Somalian government training coast guards to deal with the threat of piracy which peaked in 20093. The legal status of PMCs, compared with mercenaries, makes them a preferable choice for the aforementioned tasks reducing the prominence of illegal hired guns."}
{"id": 1969, "content": "Almost all terrorist groups kill people, whether innocents or members of the military. Even those who limit casualties by giving warnings of their atrocities are unperturbed when they do end up taking lives. Negotiation can then be the best way to save lives both in the short and long term. In the short term negotiating can mean a cease fire, and if there are hostages their release. Over the long term negotiation is necessary if there is to be any peaceful conclusion to the conflict. As the right to life is the most fundamental right, and the duty of the states to protect its citizens is primary role of the state it is clear that the protection of these lives should be the main consideration for the state."}
{"id": 1970, "content": "People have a right not to be engaged by voting, and all the more so for a parliament they see as a gravy train with little political power. The European Parliament has comparatively little power, and where it does have power it does not affect the issues that concern people; taxes, welfare, education, and health."}
{"id": 1971, "content": "The rule of law, limits on the power of the state, and the provision of personal rights are key to any country being considered to be a liberal democracy but these are being undermined in Turkey. This is most noticeable when it comes to freedom of the press. Turkey’s press freedoms have been in decline. It is a dismal 154th on the press freedom index  and most notable is that it is the country with the most imprisoned journalists with at least 76 imprisoned, mostly without having been convicted and as a result of their work."}
{"id": 1972, "content": "The trigger for the rioting; construction projects building over a park and a square are a good analogy for the government as a whole. The AKP government does not care for public opinion and is happy to push through projects without reference to it. In the case of Taksim square the government did not consult about plans to bulldoze the park despite it being the site of a massacre in 1977 making it a place of historical significance. A court ruling to stop construction was also ignored."}
{"id": 1973, "content": "There has now been more than thirty years without an army coup but it has only been during the AKP government that the army has finally been cowed with the army being forced to defend its actions in court. The National Security Council was turned from a executive body into an advisory board that was dominated by civilians and Parliamentary control over the military’s budget was strengthened. The Government’s control over the military was shown by the Ergenekon trials where senior army generals were accused of plotting a coup, with the result that the government showed the power of the judiciary over the military and took control over promotion."}
{"id": 1974, "content": "Campaign finance reform gives the individual donor a voice more comparable to other donors’ interests. At present, the enormous amount of money channeled into campaigns by large corporations, unions, and special interest groups through PACs overwhelm the smaller, limited contributions of individual donors. Reforming the super PACs and limiting these large group donations would increase the significance of donations by individual voters, likely increasing the responsiveness of candidates to voters/donors and so increasing their accountability to their electorate. Additionally, the increased significance of individual contributions encourages voter participation and activism."}
{"id": 1975, "content": "If the government agrees that 16 year olds can have sex, join the army, and apply for a passport, then surely they are mature and responsible enough to decide who runs their country and makes important decisions that affect them. Their bodies are fully adult, they have been educated for at least 10 years, and most of them have some experience of work as well as school. By this time, it is likely a teenager will have developed “Advanced reasoning skills...the ability to think about multiple options and possibilities. It includes a more logical thought process and the ability to think about things hypothetically”. Indeed by 16 children are as tolerant as adults and their political skill (the perceived ability to participate effectively in civil life by writing to political leaders and by speaking publically at meetings) is as high at 16 as for those in their late twenties."}
{"id": 1976, "content": "Governments do things which affect every age group but that does not mean everyone deserves the vote. Should 12 year olds get the vote because school policies affect them? Should toddlers get the vote because health services affect them? No - we trust parents to cast votes after thinking about the interests of their families. And there are other ways for young people to have a say - they can write to elected representatives and newspapers, sign petitions, speak at public meetings, join youth parliaments, etc. It is notable that sixteen year olds themselves are divided on whether they should have the vote,  if many of them trust their parents to vote for them should not the government?"}
{"id": 1977, "content": "Just because 16 year olds have the right to do some things, it doesn’t mean that they should use them. If all 16 year olds left home at 16 and started families it would be considered a disaster. And not all rights are given at 16 - most countries have a higher age for important things such as drinking alcohol, serving on a jury, joining the military, etc. It makes sense for different rights to be gained at different times as young people mature and get used to more responsibility. The more difficult and complex the choices involved in that right and the greater the impact the later a right should be given. Because voting is so important, involves complex decision making, and can potentially have a large impact, it should be one of the last rights to be gained. It then makes sense that it voting should be granted at the time we consider adulthood to be beginning, which was agreed in the declaration of the rights of the child is 18."}
{"id": 1978, "content": "Everyone would agree that there has to be a minimum voting age. Most people believe that the line should be drawn at 18 rather than 16. Although some 16 year olds may be mature enough to vote, most have not yet formed political views of their own yet. On average, young people are much more likely to be ready for the responsibility of voting at 18. There is then no reason why 16 would make a better cut off point than 18. At both ages some rights are given, at both there will be some who pay tax who are not given representation, at both some will be immature. There is no clear dividing line so there can be no clear reasoning for lowering the voting age to 16."}
{"id": 1979, "content": "The scrapping of the double jeopardy would be practicable if it was permitted for serious crimes, like murder and rape, and only when fresh, compelling evidence of guilt emerges that calls into question the original acquittal. Such restrictions on any scrapping of the rule would not tie up courts in re-trials, for they could only be called for certain crimes in certain, restricted conditions. The British Law Commission in a 2011 review concluded that whilst the ancient rule of double jeopardy is of 'fundamental importance', it should be possible to \"quash acquittals in murder trials where there is 'reliable and compelling new evidence of guilt'\". In practise, this would preserve the traditional advantages of the law, whilst ensuring that those who are guilty, and can be proved so, do not remain free."}
{"id": 1980, "content": "Individuals are sovereign over their own bodies, and should be free to make choices which affect them and not other individuals. Since the pleasure gained from drugs and the extent to which this weighs against potential risks is fundamentally subjective, it is not up to the state to legislate in this area. Rather than pouring wasted resources into attempting to suppress drug use, the state would be better off running information campaigns to educate people about the risks and consequences of taking different types of drugs."}
{"id": 1981, "content": "Low prices for drugs will hugely increase consumption of drugs, amongst all groups - addicts, previously casual users, and those who were not previously users. If drug provision is strictly regulated, an illegal black market may remain."}
{"id": 1982, "content": "Deterrence works through several mechanisms; likelihood of getting caught, severity of punishment, and perceived public disapproval. Mandatory minimum sentences increase the effectiveness of severity as a deterrent. If potential criminals know a mild sentence is possible, they are more likely to commit crime in the hopes that they may charm a judge into sympathetically lowering their sentence. By establishing a set minimum punishment, a potential criminal with any knowledge of the penal code knows that, if caught, he/she will face a substantial punishment for his/her crime. The pro need not demonstrate that every, or even a strong majority, of would-be criminals will be deterred by mandatory minimum sentences; so long as the mandate has a reasonable deterrent effect, it will reduce crime and therefore improve the overall standard of living."}
{"id": 1983, "content": "Incapacitation is one of the 4 basic reasons for punishment. Mandatory minimum sentences keep criminals out of society for a longer period of time than they might otherwise be in jail, thereby reducing their window of opportunity to commit crime. The criminal justice system is obligated to refrain from cruel or unusual punishment, but its main purpose is to protect society from law-breakers through various means of preventing and punishing illegal activity. Mandatory minimum sentences should be proportionate to the severity of the crime, thus satisfying the requirement of humane punishment. Thus mandatory minimum sentencing is a just method of protecting the public."}
{"id": 1984, "content": "Former Supreme Justice Sandra Day O’Connor once said, “liberty finds no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt.”  Without mandates, judges may have radically different ideas of just sentences. Michael Simons gives the example of Mutt and Jim- two criminals of identical background who commit the same crime. Judge Lenient sentences Mutt, while Judge Harsh sentences Jeff. Mutt might receive one day in prison while Jeff receives a sentence of twenty-five years. Consistent precedent is essential because citizens need to be able to make decisions knowing the legal consequences of their actions. Mandatory sentencing need not be overly harsh, but there should be some sort of rigidity to establish reliability in the legal system."}
{"id": 1985, "content": "Prosecutors can stack charges, which they can use to scare a defendant into accepting a plea bargain. Prosecutors are part of the executive branch; they are directly answerable to elected officials (and are often elected themselves), whereas judges are generally more removed from political influence. Politicians often promote themselves as being “tough on crime.”  In order to make good on this claim, they may pressure prosecutors to increase conviction rates, get longer sentences, etc. Thus political pressure may lead prosecutors to handle cases in a way that makes them more popular with the public, rather than one which gives the criminal their fair due. Because judges are less susceptible to public pressure, it is safer to entrust discretion to them."}
{"id": 1986, "content": "Minimum sentences force minor criminals to spend more time in prison, thereby increasing their exposure to more hardened criminals. This exposure reduces their chance of rehabilitation- other inmates act as a “bad influence.”  Furthermore, studies of labor market participation demonstrate that the more time a person spends outside the labor force, the more their human capital (i.e. marketable skills) deteriorate; their chance of finding well-paid work decreases with more time outside the labor force."}
{"id": 1987, "content": "Bullying can inflict serious psychological harm on its victims, especially in the case of young people. It leads to low self-esteem, depression, and for some kids it leads to suicide . Bullied children are almost 6 times more likely to think about or attempt suicide . This phenomenon has been termed ‘bullycide’ and the law should recognize it. Many forms of behaviour that result in the death of another person are criminal, from murder to negligence. It is the duty of the law to brand such behaviour as unacceptable, deter future incidents, punish the perpetrators, and offer comfort to victims: in this case, the families of those who lost their life to bullying."}
{"id": 1988, "content": "In criminal law, the establishment of culpability does not always depend on the intentions of the perpetrator. If, during a fight on a train platform, I shove someone and that person falls on the tracks and is killed by a train, I will be guilty of manslaughter, whether I intended to kill the person or not, because the harm caused by my actions is so great . The same applies to bullying. Bullies try to hurt their victims through their actions, either physically or psychologically. Whether the bully intended for the victim to die or not, is irrelevant. The bully’s actions were responsible for the victim taking her own life. Principles of Criminal Law, Chapter 7.5 ."}
{"id": 1989, "content": "In any free and democratic society, criminal law should only hold people accountable for the things they do, not for the actions of others. We are all autonomous, moral agents who make decisions and have to live with their consequences and the consequences of our actions. While it might be justified to punish bullies for their bullying behavior, if it breaks the law, we cannot hold them accountable for another person’s decision to commit suicide."}
{"id": 1990, "content": "Defining bullying would be nearly impossible. Spreading rumours, giving someone the silent treatment, inviting all your classmates but one to a party, expressing a religious belief about someone’s sexuality, eye rolling, making faces, these can all be hurtful and perceived as bullying . Yet this is perfectly legal behaviour. Criminalizing bullying would amount to criminalizing these acts. They may be offensive, they may even be hurtful, but these gestures should never, ever constitute criminal behaviour in any society that is concerned with human rights, freedom of speech, and of expression. Throwing someone in prison for spreading rumours or eye rolls might be worthy of a totalitarian state, but not a liberal democracy. No Room for Bullies: from the Classroom to Cyberspace ."}
{"id": 1991, "content": "Many of the children and adolescents who take their own lives allegedly as a result of bullying have a far more complicated background. Some already struggle with depression, and have unstable family situations that make it hard to turn to their parents for help with their problems. Phoebe Prince, for example, was taking anti-depressants, was devastated by her parents’ divorce, was self harming, and had already attempted suicide after a break up. And that was long before she was allegedly bullied to death . She was a very troubled young woman, and anything could have pushed her over the edge. It would be hard to find the bullies criminally responsible for her death."}
{"id": 1992, "content": "Schools are educational establishments that parents trust to protect and educate their children. Teachers and school administrators are those who should be keeping a watchful eye on the students in their care and intervene before harm comes to them. If bullying occurs at school, then that school has failed in its duties. In fact, in cases where suicides occurred, it has often later come to light that a bullying culture was widely tolerated at the school, and that school staff that knew about it did nothing to prevent it, with tragic results . To prosecute the bullies would shift responsibility from the woeful failure of the adults around them, who should have known better and done more than the children in their care."}
{"id": 1993, "content": "According to studies, bullies are often children who are plagued by their own problems: a troubled family situation, feeling of inadequacy, depression, or pressure to fit in . Their bullying behaviour might just be a coping mechanism and a cry for help. These children might need as much support and care as those they bully. Putting them through the harrowing experience of a criminal trial, and potentially throwing them in prison will further damage them. Destroying one young life as retribution for another is a model of justice that should find no place in a compassionate society."}
{"id": 1994, "content": "Distinctions between violent and non-violent offences are not useful when deciding which offenders should be imprisoned and which should receive more lenient, rehabilitative sentences. The severity of a crime can only be defined by its context and consequences, not by semi-arbitrary labels such as violent and non-violent. All forms of criminality, and not just violent crimes, can have disturbing and traumatic consequences. The effect of a robbery on the physical health and psychological stability of an elderly person can be as pronounced as the effects of a violent assault on a healthy young man. It is disingenuous to claim that the nature of a criminal act can be separated from that act’s effects on a victim. As the widely known common law maxim states, a victim should be taken as he is found. A reasonable adult citizen will not be excused from responsibility for what he knew to be a harmful criminal act simply because he did not foresee the extent or type of harm he would do. A judicial system that takes the concept of proportionality seriously should be free to decide that the consequences of a robbery committed against an impoverished, frail widow should result in a more severe sentence than a teenager’s impulsive attempt to shop-lift alcohol. Similarly, the outcome of a wide ranging financial fraud is likely to be more harmful than the outcome of a fist fight between two drunken football fans. Judges are allowed to exercise discretion so that they can adapt the broad rules and objectives of sentencing to the nuances of each case brought before them. The context and consequences of criminal activity should inform sentencing decisions, not an artificially narrow definition of “violence”."}
{"id": 1995, "content": "A custodial sentence has strong symbolic value, for offenders, for victims and for society as a whole. Exclusion from society and confiscation of freedoms that the state would normally protect at any cost is a powerful message, one that can be understood easily by both white collar fraudsters and semi-literate muggers. There are few more effective ways of communicating society’s disapproval and indicating the boundaries of its tolerance. For all side proposition’s talk of long term consequences and proportionality, there remain a significant number of offenders and potential offenders who would perceive the resolution as a weakness to be exploited. We give up the symbol of incarceration at the cost of emboldening criminals. Confidence in the state is founded on the state’s ability to protect its citizens and their property from physical harm. This is something on which all but the most extreme ends of the political spectrum would agree. Even if the state is no longer willing to wield violence against a criminal minority in protection of a law abiding majority, it should still be prepared to project the power that contemporary constitutional settlements have allowed it to retain. If it does not, the state risks being accused of forgetting its core duties in favour of more abstract notions of “harm”."}
{"id": 1996, "content": "Beyond increasing drug use through condoning the practice, needle exchanges also facilitate drug use by gathering all the drug addicts in a single area. This allows drug dealers to operate more efficiently and as such gives them more time to explore new markets for their drugs. As well as this, people are encouraged to keep on taking drugs as they feel the risk to them from doing so has been significantly decreased by the exchange. Given the lower risk, those drug users that are still somewhat rational actors will be more likely to take drugs because of the lower potential harm. Further, in the long run, needle exchanges through these mechanisms make it harder to eradicate drug use entirely in the future. By causing addicts and the public to accept drugs needle exchanges ingrain drugs in society as any removal of the facility in the future will be seen as the state coming down too harshly on drug addicts and can be opposed much more easily.1   1.

{"id": 1997, "content": "It is nonsensical to withhold evidence from a jury that might be necessary for them to reach an accurate verdict. Just because their verdict might be more prone to conviction rather than acquittal does not necessarily mean that this is an unfair or even inaccurate conclusion; given that violent offenders are likely to re-offend , it may illuminate the truth rather than confuse it. Jurors should be allowed to weigh the relevance of previous convictions and compare them with the accusations of the trail at hand. A criminal justice system which currently relies on the ability of the jury to make a decision  cannot legitimately choose to withhold evidence from them without innately biasing the trial itself. As the UK Government’s White Paper states, ‘we want less evidence to be withheld from the courts, on the principle that relevant evidence should be admissible . magistrates, judges and juries have the common sense to evaluate relevant evidence and should be trusted to do so’ . If we cannot trust juries to decide which evidence is relevant to the verdict and which is not, then the entire use of juries in the criminal justice system should be reconsidered."}
{"id": 1998, "content": "Jurors are frequently affected by media coverage of particular cases, which makes it almost impossible for them to remain impartial in the idealistic way which opposition naively believes possible. This creates a situation where the jury may be more affected by information which they have found out elsewhere – for example on the news or in newspapers – than the information which is presented to them in court. There have been some cases where jurors search the internet to find the backgrounds to their cases, despite the fact that this is not allowed . This evidently reflects that jurors feel that they have not been adequately informed and so seek facts elsewhere. Given that this need has been reflected by the jurors themselves, the court should give jurors all possible information and bring previous convictions into the open to ensure that they can base their verdict on reliable fact presented in court rather than resorting to sensationalist media."}
{"id": 1999, "content": "This motion could allow innocent defendants to mount a stronger case. This is because, if allowed, the previous convictions of prosecution witnesses would be admitted as evidence. In this case, if a prosecution witness falsely claims good character in opposition to the defendant, any falsity could be more easily seen and weighed by the jury. This solves a problem under that status quo where ‘the threat of introducing his ; fear that the defendant’s convictions may weigh against them where the prosecution witness remains untouchable creates a discrepancy in the justice system. However, if convictions on both sides were to be revealed anyway, then neither can falsely claim the character of the other and attempt to convince the jury of false information on this front."}
{"id": 2000, "content": "By projecting past convictions on to a new case, this disclosure greatly weakens the presumption of innocence which is the defendant’s right . It is the jury’s duty to form a verdict based on the relevant case, and it should not be dependent on events from the defendant’s past life which may be completely irrelevant to the case in hand. Many people who mistakenly committed a crime at one point in their life realise that it was a mistake and do  not  go on to re-offend, particularly if they have received help or treatment from the state . Even if the defendant  has  repeatedly committed crimes in their past, it does not necessarily follow that they are guilty of the particular offence which has gone to trial."}
{"id": 2001, "content": "This motion removes the incentive for police to conduct vigorous investigations. Given the increasing pressure on policemen and women to gain convictions , this motion will mean that their best chance of obtaining those convictions is simply to accuse those whose backgrounds could feasibly lead a jury to believe that they are not only capable of crime, but have committed the crime in question. Subsequently, the  real  culprits may be left to go free as suspicion is routinely pointed towards those who already have a criminal record. Given that poor police investigation  are currently a large source of dissatisfaction with the justice system, it is important to prevent either police or the prosecution from becoming dependent on the negative records of the defendants rather than properly fulfilling their roles."}
{"id": 2002, "content": "Though it is true the international Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutes and investigates crimes against humanity, the destruction and desecration of cultural property cannot be categorised as a crime against humanity. This is quite simply because human beings are not directly harmed when cultural property like ancient monuments or old scripts are destroyed. According to the ICC, the following would consist of crimes against humanity: ‘Murder, extermination; enslavement; deportation or forcible transfer of population; imprisonment; torture; rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization, or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity; persecution against an identifiable group on political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious or gender grounds; enforced disappearance of persons; the crime of apartheid; other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering or serious bodily or mental injury’ . The common factor with all these crimes is that they are committed as part of a ‘widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population’. This is simply because the ICC and the international community recognise that the most serious crimes that fall under the category of crimes against humanity are crimes of this nature that violently and systematically attack the wellbeing of civilians on a gross scale. The destruction or damage to any property, be it homes, government buildings, or sites of cultural heritage may well be a crime and a heinous act, but cannot come under the category of crimes against humanity."}
{"id": 2003, "content": "A regional court would be a good way to balance the competing issues between the legitimate concerns of the African states and the International Criminal Court. It would be able to provide an African solution to African problems, with no accusations of external interference or colonialism. Similarly, it would have some of the advantages of the ICC particularly its independence from individual states, meaning those in high places are more likely to be held to account. With this accountability to an African court there would be an impression of being held to account by peers not outsiders."}
{"id": 2004, "content": "The balance between peace and justice is a complex issue. The ICC has disregarded peace as a priority in cases, focusing exclusively on justice by indicting individuals, which reduces the diplomatic leeway and drives those indicted towards a bunker mentality. The result then may be the conflict goes on longer and more crimes are committed. Peace and preventing future crimes should come before justice for past crimes. The ICC have focused on prosecuting Omar al Bashir, but it may be a better option to focus on diplomatic alternatives to trials for dealing with the conflict in Darfur."}
{"id": 2005, "content": "Depending on how the treaty is drawn up, an African Criminal Court could be open to abuse. If it has too broad powers, it could lead to political trials thanks to judges following orders from their domestic governments, and complaints to it by governments in diplomatic spats rather than actually resolving serious international criminal law crimes. The same disputes that exist now within the ICC over issues such as interference with national sovereignty could just be replicated on a smaller scale – but rather than resembling a failure of any international body, it would be a regional body and lead to greater problems. If the ICC indicts a leader there is anger at the international community, if an ACC does the same there is a split in the AU."}
{"id": 2006, "content": "The sole motive for the anti-ICC arguments raised by organizations such as the African Union is a drive towards impunity – particularly for heads of state. The prosecutions of Uhuru Kenyatta and Omar al-Bashir, so viciously opposed by the AU, are a show that heads of state are and should be subject to the international criminal law – a principle that dates back to Nuremberg. An African Criminal Court would simply be granting African leaders’ carte blanche to perform crimes against humanity, as there would be a ready-made court to acquit them."}
{"id": 2007, "content": "Even before most of the violence by riot police in February some experts were suggesting that Yanukovych had committed crimes against humanity – crimes committed by a state against a civilian population. Professor Alexander J Motyl argued “The Yanukovych regime may already be guilty of “imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law” and “persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious, gender … or other grounds.””  Now at the very least murder can be added to that count."}
{"id": 2008, "content": "It is questionable whether Yanukovych’s crimes, as abhorrent as they may be, really qualify for the ICC. It is clear that he does not qualify for three of the four crimes the ICC charges; genocide, war crimes, and the crime of aggression (this is for attacking other states not your own people). This leaves crimes against humanity. Crimes against humanity can include murder when “committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population”  so the ICC will need to decide whether less than 100 dead is widespread and grave enough to justify the charge – and this is something that is up to the prosecutor."}
{"id": 2009, "content": "Since becoming operational in March 2003 the ICC has only had one case resulting in a conviction and it is currently being appealed. Despite being found guilty of the war crime of recruiting and forcing child soldiers to fight and kill, Thomas Lubanga was sentenced to just 14 years imprisonment. Lubanga was arrested and sent to the Court in March 2006. This single ICC conviction and the light sentence imposed are hardly sufficient to deter other warlords from using child soldiers. Six years later, in the same country where Lubanga’s crimes occurred, thousands of child soldiers are being recruited by various armed groups."}
{"id": 2010, "content": "By prosecuting only those leaders deemed ‘most responsible’ for the crimes in question, the ICC is effectively allowing lower-ranked perpetrators to commit crimes with impunity. These rank and file troops generally have little awareness or understanding of international criminal laws. Furthermore, just as local domestic laws fail to deter offenders who often commit crimes with little thought of being punished, distant ICC threats are even less likely to deter those whose actions are easily manipulated and controlled by militia leaders. Child soldiers, in particular, have often been drugged before going into combat."}
{"id": 2011, "content": "There is compelling evidence that the ICC’s past or current investigations have caused potential perpetrators as well as those already indicted, to abandon their plans. For example, as the ICC’s first Prosecutor noted, even before the Court had convicted Thomas Lubanga for the recruitment of child soldiers, its African investigations were enough to prompt responses in Columbia and Sri Lanka, resulting in children being released."}
{"id": 2012, "content": "As an international court of ‘last resort’, the ICC’s very existence serves as a constant reminder of the failings of national and regional governments to effectively curtail crimes against humanity in all their forms. Therefore, the Court exerts a strong deterrent effect by implicitly challenging the adequacy of those governments whose judicial systems allow such crimes to be committed with impunity. Seeking to avoid such international embarrassment has itself been enough to motivate many countries to both join the ICC Assembly and aim to improve their own domestic judicial systems. A clear example of this direct effect was the Kenyan government’s judicial and electoral reforms that followed from the ICC’s indictments over the post-election violence in 2007 which made the judiciary and election commission constitutionally much more independent."}
{"id": 2013, "content": "While Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto have been visiting the ICC, they should have been leading their countries. While the indictment has occurred both have remained the leaders of their countries, but have been absent while major events such as the Westgate shootings occurred. Despite the need to strong leadership in the midst of a potentially divisive event, Ruto was only granted one week away from trial. Absence of leadership during the fear and uncertainty surrounding this event might lead to a fresh round of violence as supporters take to the streets in protest – this election had put former enemies Kenyatta and Ruto together, easing ethnic tensions in the region ."}
{"id": 2014, "content": "While the ICC feels free to interfere with African countries it would never dare to do so in a western country; leaders such as George Bush, Tony Blair, Nicholas Sarkozy and others who have launched various armed interventions have not been put on trial. Not only is it victimization and interference the trial of Kenyatta is also likely to be pointless; it is on the point of collapse. The prosecutor Fatou Bensouda has stated “Having carefully considered my evidence and the impact of the two withdrawals, I have come to the conclusion that currently the case against Mr. Kenyatta does not satisfy the high evidentiary standards required at trial”."}
{"id": 2015, "content": "Prosecutions are the only way for victims to see those who caused pain against them brought to justice. The alternative of some kind of reconciliation often leaves those who perpetrated crimes able to retain power as has happened in countries like Bosnia and Herzegovina, Colombia and Guatemala. When this happens there is clearly a concern both that these individuals are not being held to account and that they could act in a similar way again if given the opportunity. Under the United Nations Genocide Convention of 1948, victims have a right to see offenders prosecuted. And it is only prosecution that will ensure that such acts cannot occur again so giving peace of mind to victims."}
{"id": 2016, "content": "Prosecuting offenders is the only way to get a just outcome when there have been horrific crimes committed. At a most principled level, those who commit a crime ought to be held accountable for their actions even if they are powerful or it damages the chances of peace because the powerful must be shown not to be above the law. Even where the law did not exist, or the leaders were in control of the law, international norms provide a standard for what actions merit prosecution, and judiciaries have been very good at convicting those who committed atrocities. Having those who committed crimes convicted by law courts helps prevent those affected by atrocities holding grudges and put the past behind them so aiding the healing process ."}
{"id": 2017, "content": "By introducing internationally based prosecution, the laws are able to effectively filter down into the domestic system. The international system takes care of powerful offenders who might otherwise not receive a fair trial or be brought to justice. This then allows domestic courts to prosecute those involved in the crimes at a lower level. This has worked in Ivory coast where the former leader was brought to face charges committed at home and also helped stabilize the situation in the country ."}
{"id": 2018, "content": "By prosecuting those who commit crimes against humanity and war crimes future leaders are dissuaded from committing such acts . When criminals are held accountable, the belief in the reliability of the legal system is enhanced, society is strengthened by the experience that the legal system is able to defend itself and the sense of justice is upheld or rectified . Since the Office of the Prosecutor announced its interest in Colombia in 2006, the government has taken a number of measures particularly the Peace and Justice Law to ensure domestic prosecution of those who could potentially be tried by the ICC. The threat of ICC prosecution appears to have concerned former President Pastrana. Vincente Castrano (AUC) a paramilitary leader was fearful of the possibility of ICC prosecution, a fear that reportedly directly contributed to his group’s demobilisation."}
{"id": 2019, "content": "In practice, prosecutions often come at the expense of other forms of reconciliation. For instance before Truth and Reconciliation Commissions can work amnesties have to be given for people to be willing to tell their stories. In order for people to put down weapons, or agree to tell stories, prosecutions must be given up. This is evident with the conflict is South Sudan; the opposition which had signed the ceasefire agreement to restore stability in the region, breached it and started fighting again when many of its members were indicted for the crimes they had committed . In such case the most important thing is to prevent future atrocities as healing can only start when there is no conflict or atrocities going on."}
{"id": 2020, "content": "It is a fundamental principle of morality that individuals should be held responsible for their crimes – that is the reason why we, as societies, have criminal law. Prosecuting people – holding them responsible for their crimes – is a moral imperative. We all wish to live in  a society where everyone is equally accountable when they commit crime as one in which not everyone is held to account is fundamentally unjust; it creates one rule for the powerless and another for those who are ‘needed’ to help create peace. This would simply incentivise people to try to make themselves indispensable strongmen – not a sustainable basis for a peaceful society."}
{"id": 2021, "content": "Argentina did not prosecute for a long time after the collapse of the junta , a 1986 law, commonly known as the Full Stop Law (also known by its number, Law 23492), prohibited prosecution of those involved in the dirty war which resulted in up to 30,000 deaths. However, Argentina managed to build a lasting peace, and society without prosecutions."}
{"id": 2022, "content": "The ICC has not been particularly effective in dealing with the situation in Uganda, the ICC prosecutions having been a distraction to local community reconciliation and leading to further violence  . Similarly, the situation in Darfur has not been helped by ICC involvement, with mass destruction of villages by people already indicted by the International Criminal Court . Due to his indictment, a diplomatic solution has become harder as Rome Statute signatories are under a legal duty to arrest Sudanese leader Omar al-Bashir, although many have just ignored this."}
{"id": 2023, "content": "The ICC means an end to impunity. It has meant that warlords such as Germain Katanga have been able to be prosecuted for things like using child soldiers, which are universally reviled. What the African Union leaders are simply advocating by withdrawal from the ICC is impunity for themselves. They see one of their own – Uhuru Kenyatta, who has to face very serious allegations over his part in the mayhem after the 2007 elections which killed over a thousand people – being prosecuted and then claim it is selective. The only selection going on is that those who do not have a case to answer are not being prosecuted."}
{"id": 2024, "content": "Domestic legal systems will often suffer from a lack of judicial independence and potentially politicised prosecutions, and are also open to allegations of victors’ justice, or whitewashes by a judiciary biased towards the winners of the conflict. The ICC, as an effective court and with an independent judiciary, provides a suitable and unbiased climate for these cases to be heard in. While it is difficult to give any former head of state a fair trial, it is even more so in cases involving states divided along ethnic and political fault lines where any conviction could be seen as one based on continuing hatreds rather than evidence and criminal procedure. In addition, the principle of complementarity means African states can prosecute on their own if they wish."}
{"id": 2025, "content": "The concept of punishment is inherently based on retribution. We inflict pain-suffering, discomfort-to the degree they deserve to feel it.”  Retribution can be distinguished from revenge – retribution does not always seek to impose punishment that is the same as the original act, and never more. The punishment must fit the crime so capital punishment is therefore an appropriate punishment for the worst of the worst – an eye for an eye."}
{"id": 2026, "content": "While budget should not be the primary concern of the justice system, The death penalty, when applied properly, can be cheaper. A lethal injection, or a few bullets, costs far less than keeping a person incarcerated for a long time, especially if they need long term health or other care in old age. The longer someone is in jail the greater the cost to the state. The costs of the implementation of the death penalty are driven up by anti-death penalty activists using the appeals system. Since the death penalty would only be applied to the worst of the worst when there is absolute moral certainty there would be less need for extensive appeals because there would be less marginal cases."}
{"id": 2027, "content": "Those who have damaged society by robbing it of one of its members must pay for their crime. Adam Smith argued “We feel that resentment which we imagine he ought to feel, and which he would feel, if in his cold and lifeless body there remained any consciousness of what passes upon earth. His blood, we think, calls aloud for vengeance.”  It is not just the wronged individual who needs there to be retribution but society as a whole. Everyone in society is wronged by particularly heinous crimes as Blecker says of two horrific crimes “Those were my children, my wife that Coker raped and murdered, my sister Speck killed”."}
{"id": 2028, "content": "We as individuals created the state in order to protect and improve our lives. We gave it the burden of improving our lives from multiple points of view, economically, socially, environmentally, etc. But before these, in order for one to benefit from this advantages that the state brings, he must be alive, therefore the main burden and purpose of the state is the protection of its citizens’ lives. As a result, when judging a principle, one must mainly look if it is helping or preventing the state from reaching its ultimate purpose. As a result, it is legitimate to risk sacrificing your right to private life in order for better protection. The existence of mandatory warrants can bring, as an advantage, only a vague feeling of safety and happiness, as there is no real harm for you if someone is tapping your phone, as long as you are a law-abiding citizen. On the other hand a world in which the government wouldn’t be forced to obtain warrants would be much safer for the individuals, as the government would be able to intercept and trace more criminals. If one life is saved by this policy, it will be worth it!"}
{"id": 2029, "content": "A key principle of the rule of law is that everyone is subject to the law – even the agents of states . It must apply equally to the most as well as the least powerful. This must apply to international criminal law as well as the domestic criminal law. It would be unjustifiable for one individual to be able to face prosecution as a private citizen for genocide, but not a head of state who has much greater capacity to engage in such acts. It effectively would allow genocide, which is prohibited by a convention the vast majority of states have signed and ratified, as an expression of national sovereignty."}
{"id": 2030, "content": "International criminal law, like any other form of criminal law, is supposed to be a deterrent. By giving a class of individuals impunity, these people cannot be deterred by International Criminal Law from committing some of the worst crimes known to humanity, including genocide. It is plain that many people who reach the heights of political power will use any method to remain in power – thus the resort to intimidation where it can be used to affect the vote, or in the case of Silvio Berlusconi the attempt to put in place an immunity law to prevent himself from being prosecuted for corruption."}
{"id": 2031, "content": "Televising criminal trials may cause a number of problems with witnesses. It may make individuals less likely to give evidence, make them more likely to play to the television audience, or make the already intimidating process of giving evidence in court more so. Also, television broadcasts make it more likely that the identities of anonymized witnesses would leak out – something that has already happened at the ICC in the Ruto-Sang case . The ICC already has problems with witnesses, including allegations of bribing and intimidating prosecution witnesses in the Ruto case . Ending the televising of trials may go some way to remedy those problems."}
{"id": 2032, "content": "The ICC as a court does not have many of the things that a domestic criminal trial would have in terms of disadvantages of televising. Like all other international tribunals, there is no jury, only a panel of professional judges. Judges are going to be less intimidated by there being television broadcasts even if broadcasts of trials typically aim to obscure the identity of the jury. Similarly, there is a competent system of witness protection, and other safeguards."}
{"id": 2033, "content": "Unlike many other criminal trials, since Nuremberg a key principle of International Criminal Law is that it aims to set a historical record. The events that it deals with are important as they are heinous crimes that change regions forever. A trial helps to get to the bottom of events that happened preventing there being multiple conflicting versions of events. This record also can help to act as a deterrent to others considering similar measures. Broadcasting the trial will bolster this record by providing footage of the trial itself (which may reduce myths about it being unfair, for example) and providing a voice to the victims through their evidence, in their own words, being recorded for posterity and future study."}
{"id": 2034, "content": "It is incoherent to attempt to ban assault weapons while allowing other weapons to remain on the streets. As professor Jacobs from New York University argues “Pistols are dangerous because they are easily carried and concealed; shotguns because they spray metal projectiles over a wide area; certain hunting rifles because they fire large calibre bullets, and certain \"sniper rifles\" because they are accurate over great distances. Assault rifles are not remarkable by any of these criteria.”  Indeed the previous ban simply used a list of guns that were banned rather than a specific definition that could then be applied universally showing the difficulty of classifying these weapons."}
{"id": 2035, "content": "The remit of the ICC is unlike the remit of any national court. It deals exclusively in crimes so unacceptable there is an international consensus behind their illegality and the need for prosecutions. The parties that signed up to the Rome Statute’s reason for the creation of the ICC was “that such grave crimes threaten the peace, security and well-being of the world” the perpetrators of such crimes clearly need to be brought to book, and to do that they need to be apprehended. The same agreement said the signatories were “Resolved to guarantee lasting respect for and the enforcement of international justice” if this is the case then there should be agreement on enabling that enforcement by creating an ICC enforcement arm. Again the Rome statute makes clear that the agreement “shall not be taken as authorizing” intervention by another state. This is why the enforcement needs to be done by a separate international force who could not be considered a threat to any state."}
{"id": 2036, "content": "To create an enforcement arm for the ICC would be to accept that state parties are incapable of enforcing decisions themselves, that is not necessarily the case. State parties have supplied the ICC with many of the defendants that it desires to face trial, including Bemba and the Gbagbos. Some, such as Uhuru Kenyatta have appeared voluntarily. The current system is working in many cases. While it does not in all, there are some that will be extremely difficult to capture by anyone."}
{"id": 2037, "content": "In a climate where the ICC’s budget is determined exclusively by contentious negotiation between states (at a time where the ICC itself has threatened to close down investigations due to a lack of funds ), many of whom are undergoing austerity, an enforcement arm is not the best use of scarce funds when its role can be taken by the state parties. The ICC is already expensive enough – it cost over €100M in 2009."}
{"id": 2038, "content": "Currently the ICC functions based on a relationship of trust and understanding with the state parties to the ICC – a bottom-up rather than a top-down approach. This is backed up by the court’s respect for the for the principle of complementarity – it is hoped that national courts are capable of prosecuting the crimes, and the ICC only takes a role if the state is unwilling or unable to do so. Being willing to use an international force to catch criminals would make a mockery of this determination to leave power and responsibilities at the national level wherever possible. Having ICC forces on a country’s territory would be humiliating, showing that the international community does not trust that nation to catch war criminals itself. While this model did not provide for attempting to snatch government officials who have been indicted it does leave open the possibility of an international force intruding on states sovereignty without consent. This would diplomatically backfire and could even lead to an ICC force being involved in fighting with government forces protecting their national sovereignty."}
{"id": 2039, "content": "Victims of violent crimes and their families face an emotional and vulnerable time in the wake of such crimes. People need time to recover, or mourn. The media’s fixation on violent crimes subjects these vulnerable people to the assault of reporters. In fact, there exists a perverse incentive for the media to badger families until they break down, as tears sell. Such exploitation must be stopped, and the best way to do that is to deny the media the ability to report on such things. The media does not care about hurting feelings, and bad behavior on the part of reporters never hurts readership of media outlets, as is indicative of such tabloids as the  National Enquirer . Outlets can always deflect any backlash that might occur for their excesses by cutting loose “rogue reporters”. Furthermore, families and victims usually do not want the media's, and the nation’s eyes upon them. Rather they tend to seek support from family and community, not the faceless masses. They may not want to become part of a media-driven narrative, and certainly not to become symbols for a new social crusade to reform communities. Removing violent reporting removes these perverse incentives to irritate victims and families, and instead leads to more respectful and considerate treatment. As for those accused of crimes, it can be hard for someone acquitted after a trial or accusation to get on with life. Some people may find themselves roundly accused by the media and public, even portrayed as monster, making it very hard to move on, even when their names are officially cleared. This is completely contrary to how the legal system should function, where acquittal is meant to deliver absolution. Allowing the media to construct narratives of guilt in the absence of evidence undermines the very fabric of justice. The media’s incessant coverage of violent crimes and its alacrity to make accusations and jump to conclusions can destroy someone’s life, more than even having to stand trial does. Justice must prevail and be fair to those to whom it judges in court, and this can only be done by not allowing the media to turn the mob against people even after their names are cleared."}
{"id": 2040, "content": "The media is regularly accused of being sensationalist and of hyping up the extent and gruesomeness of violent crimes. In some cases this may be true, but the media generally reports facts in a sober and informative, if also exciting, way. Without the mainstream media, however, news about violent crimes will still spread. The news will be disseminated within local communities and across the Internet via email and blogs. The result is lessening of journalistic quality, as bloggers are not bound by any exacting requirements in terms of the need for factual bases of stories. In the absence of mainstream reporting, especially on such a hot button issue as violent crime, will only serve to spread disinformation, leading people to draw inaccurate conclusions and make decisions based on inaccurate knowledge."}
{"id": 2041, "content": "A fine ought to be proportionate to the severity of the crime committed, not the income of the offender. It is fundamental that the justice system should treat all offenders equally; if two people commit the same crime in the same circumstances but one is richer than the other then they have caused the same amount of harm so should pay the same price for that harm. Having a richer person pay more implies that crimes by the rich are necessarily more harmful to society regardless of what the crime actually is. Further, this system will cause anomalies, where rich people fined for small offences (e.g. littering) will have much larger fines than poorer people fined for more serious offences (e.g. This will make people question the fairness of the fines, which will negatively impact their relationship with the justice system."}
{"id": 2042, "content": "The rich will feel like they are receiving an unfair, ‘greater’ punishment. This resentment will be magnified by media response: some newspapers and news outlets will choose to report this as an attack on the rich just as is the case with progressive taxation which is often attacked as an assault on ‘wealth creation’.1 This may well increase the extent to which they break the law, because if you perceive the law to be applied unfairly, you are less likely to consider it to be making an accurate assessment of whether an action is right or wrong in any given situation. That is, in situations where you are unlikely to be caught committing a crime, the deterrent is clearly not the possible punishment (which you won’t face, because you won’t be caught). Rather, the deterrent is the extent to which you believe the illegal action to be morally wrong. If you believe a law is applied unfairly, you are less likely to consider the prohibited action to be actually, morally wrong, and therefore more likely to commit that act."}
{"id": 2043, "content": "Sometimes artists go too far in a bid to get their message across. Simply grabbing the headlines with shock tactics does not constitute art of the sort that should be receiving either public support or attention. It is important to recognise that public displays and funding of art are limited commodities, so every time one piece is chosen for an exhibition, or an artist is given money, this comes at the cost of other possible pieces of art. It is surely better to support those artists who have chosen to express their ideas and messages in a way that does not rely on simple attention-grabbing horror: it is surely more artistically meritorious to create a work that conveys its message in a way that rewards close attention and careful study, with layers of meaning and technique."}
{"id": 2044, "content": "Art differs from other forms of media with regard to the expression of ideas. Unlike other methods of conveying ideas, art has a visceral impact that is instant and has a lasting effect. In a discussion, for example, there are often clues that ideas that might make people feel uncomfortable are about to arise. Thus, people are in a better position to consent to the sorts of challenges controversy within a conversation may pose (similarly, we tend to look more positively on taboo subjects raised within a conversational context than we do when they are, for example, shouted about in the street). In the case of art, particularly that which is displayed in public spaces (like squares, parks and museums) people are unable to consent in this way, but rather, may be confronted suddenly by something that they find disgusting, because it has forced them to confront something they find horrific or traumatic, in a manner which has a great impact, and that, because of the power of the visual, they find difficult to forget."}
{"id": 2045, "content": "Some forms of art rely strongly on the provocation of disgust or other strong reactions. For example, conceptual artists often rely heavily upon the provocation of strong emotions in the viewer as a way of drawing attention to important, taboo areas (e.g. death, religion and sexuality). If they are banned from doing this, then we lose an entire branch of art: we are left instead with forms of art that choose not to engage with these areas at all. Particularly in cases where people want to draw attention to what they see as unnecessary taboos, shock is integral. For example, the work of Sarah Lucas explored taboos surrounding sexuality and gender: her work drew attention to stereotyping and taboo in a way that (necessarily) many people found disgusting. Further, it is possible to critically engage with that disgust. It is wrong to assume that the end point of a provocative piece of art is “oh, I’ve been provoked”. Rather, this emotional first response is only the beginning when it comes to the contemplation of that work. Thinking about the reasons for your disgust, and its context, allows us a greater insight into the work, which if you believe ideas are central to pieces of art (which conceptual artists do) is vital."}
{"id": 2046, "content": "Artists ought to be allowed to express themselves, and display the world they see, as they see it. Freedom of speech is considered integral to the modern democracy, and with good reason! Free speech makes a vital contribution to a plurality of ideas. It is only when a great number of ideas are expressed and challenged, such that people’s beliefs remain fluid, and can be formed and reformed, that we are able to arrive at such a point where we are likely to progress. This ‘marketplace of ideas’ prevents us from stagnating; from continuing harmful practices and modes of thought simply because they are traditional. The more free speech is limited, the less able we are to access this plurality of ideas, and thus the less able we are to truly challenge harmful habits."}
{"id": 2047, "content": "Great, socially liberal movements have always been controversial, and always been supported, encouraged and propagated by art. Art is a realm wherein an artist’s expression is less limited by social structures (like the necessity of pleasing your box; of being ‘commercially viable’). Subsequently it has easily, and often, been utilised as a means of changing public opinion. Some of these movements, for example, the breaking down of stereotypes and norms surrounding sexuality (in particular female sexuality) and gender that Sarah Lucas, Tracey Emin and others contributed to in the liberalising 80s and 90s, attract social disgust. In any situation where a taboo is being attacked, this will happen. The converse however, is not the case: it is almost impossible to provoke social disgust by maintaining the status quo. As a result, restriction of art that provokes social disgust will disproportionately attack the socially liberal, and thus help to maintain the status quo, regardless of whether it is worthy of such protection."}
{"id": 2048, "content": "We are not born with an innate sense of right and wrong, a prior knowledge of what is legal and illegal. We acquire it through education, both at home and at school. The internalization of these social norms is a crucial part of becoming a law-abiding citizen and acquiring the respect toward the law our society demands. Children from poor backgrounds are more likely to be raised in environments where such distinctions are blurred, where they are exposed to negative role models within their family or community. They may also experience very erratic or low-quality schooling, This may be because the schools have inadequate levels of funding or supplies, the classes are more likely to have disruptive children or that better teachers are more sought after and thus go to other schools. As a result, they might become desensitized to crime, or violence as a result of being exposed to it on a regular basis. They might then start to view crime not as against social order but as a part of it and that will make them more likely to break the law themselves."}
{"id": 2049, "content": "We live in a culture where success and personal achievement is measured on a material scale - what you own, how much you make, what car you drive, what clothes you wear. This means that it is the way society is structured to make us crave material objects which is the primary cause of crime. As society values wealth and material goods over everything else people might turn to crime in order to acquire these much-vaunted markers of personal achievement, to which they feel entitled. Seeing no other avenue for personal and financial success, they might easily choose to get involved in illegal but somewhat profitable activities — like drug dealing, theft or burglary, running prostitution rings, racketeering, etc. However if society was to value traits such as honesty, hard work or loyalty over personal holdings then perhaps the levels of crime would not be so high."}
{"id": 2050, "content": "While it is true that crime is correlated with people coming from poorer socio-economic backgrounds this does not in itself prove that poverty itself is the cause of crime. A lack of education or bad parenting might be equally, if not more convincing explanations for both phenomena. The causation may even be reversed, with those who indulge in violent behaviour and who seek illegal short-cuts to success rather than being prepared to hold down a steady job being more likely to end up poor. For example, recent studies have found that street-level drug dealers make less than the minimum wage. In order to tackle crime, therefore, we don’t need to eradicate poverty, but improve people’s internalization of social norms through law enforcement and education."}

Moreover, the level of enjoyment that individuals derive from their jobs- and thus the nature of the hedonic calculus that they engage in when determining whether a particular job will fully account for their needs- is linked partly to the variety and difficulty of the tasks they must accomplish.

Spending some of that tuition subsidizing an internship on Capitol Hill or with a Think Tank or Lobbying firm would be far more likely to lead to later employment in politics than earning a JD and likely offer a politically interested potential law student a far more entertaining and enjoyable experience.

{"id": 2056, "content": "Peer pressure drives most drug use among children and teenagers. This occurs as some children face ostracism or exclusion from their peers in the social environment that the state compels them to be in if they refuse to take illegal drugs, if drug use is deemed necessary to be 'cool' or 'popular'. It is, generally, the state that operates a western liberal democracy’s education system. Under circumstances in which children are placed into the care of the state, and are made vulnerable to peer pressure the state has a duty to ensure that children are not coerced into using drugs. This means that concerns of 'privacy' are secondary to protecting the choice not to take drugs, as ensuring the 'privacy' of all students by not having random drug tests empowers some students to socially coerce other students into using drugs when they otherwise would not. Random drug tests help prevent cultures or norms of drug-taking (by which it can become the 'cool' thing to do) by ensuring that most drug users will be caught and helped to quit, thus protecting the choice of others not to be pressured into drug use."}
{"id": 2057, "content": "Random drug tests will pose no harm to students who do not use illegal drugs, as they have nothing to fear from this fact being certified. If anything it serves as a vindication of their law-abidance and good character. Random drug tests will only catch those who are actively taking drugs, as tests can be used which are unlikely to make a 'positive' reading from secondary exposure (for example, being near someone else smoking cannabis). Those actively taking drugs need help in getting off drugs far more urgently than they need their right to 'privacy', as addiction at a young age could have a significant negative impact upon the remainder of their time in education. Therefore, non-drug users have nothing to fear from testing. As a result random checks are in the best interests of drug users."}
{"id": 2058, "content": "Even if a right to privacy (which would prevent random drug testing with no reason for suspicion) does not exist in law in every country, many students being affected by drugs tests will perceive that the notional right to privacy which they believe they possess is being violated. Because they would perceive this violation as a harm, it should not be imposed without good reason. This problematizes the nature of 'random' testing, which by definition means forcing drug tests on individuals on whom there is no reasonable suspicion of drug use. Firstly, the majority of those being tested will most likely test negative (as the previously cited statistics suggest) and so a majority will be harmed for no fault of their own, but rather as a consequence of the crimes of others. This may be seen as the equivalent of searching all homes in a neighbourhood for an illegal weapon on the suspicion that one of them was hiding it -an action which would be illegal in almost every western liberal democracy. Further, however, even if students do engage in illegal drug use, random drug tests will additionally catch only those on whom there was previously no suspicion against (as students who show signs of drug use are already usually tested). In order to not already be under suspicion, these drug-using students would have to be engaging in their education, not disrupting the education of others, and not displaying erratic or harmful behaviour. As they are not actively harming others, these students should be subject only to the same standards as individuals in other areas of society: to only have their privacy violated by drugs tests if their behaviour actively brings them under suspicion."}
{"id": 2059, "content": "Random drug tests change the student-teacher relationship from one of trust into one of suspicion, whereby the teachers and the school establishment become a body which many students will perceive as being out to catch them, and suspicious of all. The destruction of this trust makes it far harder for teachers to impart useful information on illegal drugs and the consequences of their use to students, and students may be less willing to seek teachers out on this information. This would lead to students relying increasingly on their peers and the internet for information on illegal drugs, and this information is far more likely to be of questionable policy or influenced by notions of drug use as 'cool' or glamorous. Thus schools' anti-drugs message may be harmed by random drug tests."}

A study by Gunasekera, H. et al titled  “Sex and Drugs in Popular Movies: an Analysis of the Top 200 Films”  found that smoking was portrayed in 68% of the films and that they “...tended to portray their use positively and without negative consequences.” This normalization of smoking is hindering the effort to try and stop people taking up smoking, by regularly seeing the activity young people will consider the activity socially acceptable which gives the wrong message needed to help stop the activity and minimize health related problems from it. While films are most often fictional and produced for the purpose of entertainment people still do learn, whether rightly or wrongly, from them, it is arguably socially and morally irresponsible then for directors and films studios alike to show smoking in films without clearly demonstrating the negative side to it as it is painting an incorrect representation of what it is to be a smoker."}

The main hurdle for adding such regulation would be getting the guidelines right as to what can and cannot be shown and what is appropriate for certain age groups to see or not see. Creating the guidelines would have to involve both public and expert consultation but on the whole putting restrictions in place would face little if any practical problems."}

The government should not be trying to ban smoking in films when it is such a small issue in the grand scheme of things, especially when there are other more important issues in the world that need tackling. One of the Government’s main roles in society should be to keep the country running and not to micro-manage it, as individuals we should be able to make our own decisions to both be able to deconstruct the use of smoking within a film and to secondly be able to make the choice as to whether to smoke or not for as long as the product is legal."}

For example Slobodan Milošević the former leader of Serbia’s trial took four years and he died before the verdict was given. According to ICTY Chief Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte “The death of Slobodan Milosevic deprived victims of justice”.

Similar to the accumulation of nuclear missiles actually deterring a war between large nations, a deterrent can be created around something deemed morally wrong (a prison which may/may not breech human rights) and yet help the greatest number of people and is, thus, justifiable.

Your property cannot be stolen from you if you agree to give it away. You have no legal remedy if your property is damaged by another with your consent, or if you damage it yourself. Why should there be a moral difference when this property is flesh and blood? Paternalism in this instance only protects those who do not want to be protected. The prohibition of sadomasochism is simply inconsistent with the liberty that governments already permit their citizens to exercise to injure each other and themselves. When people are entitled to risk pain, serious injury, or even death in sporting activity, why should they not also be permitted to suffer some discomfort in consensual sexual activity? The same piercing of flesh which attracts criminal liability in a fetishistic context can be performed legally in a chemist’s shop or tattooist’s parlor. The distinction between the rugby scrum, the bungee tower and the bedroom is an arbitrary one. Some of the pleasure that is inherent in contact sports is derived from the adrenal thrill of flirting with injury. It is widely known that a significant proportion of individuals find jeopardy and danger as enjoyable as decadence. A sport purged of all risk would be unwatched and unplayed. Comparably, a corpus of law that did not acknowledge or protect the diversity of human sexual experience would needlessly limit individual sexual freedom, and would probably be ignored."}
{"id": 2075, "content": "The criminalisation of S&M removes legal protection from individuals who suffer an abuse of consent while submitting to sadistic practices. Where a dominant partner ignores safe words or pushes a session too far, the criminal status of S&M may lead to a victim being prosecuted alongside a perpetrator. Alternately, victims may be disincentivised from approaching the police altogether. Although it is not possible to be prosecuted for being the victim of a crime, individuals who are harmed during sadomasochistic sex many not be able to engage in a rational assessment of their own criminal liability. Even though laws against sadomasochistic acts pin liability only on the sadistic partner, they also serve to criminalize the act itself. Victims of abuses of consent may therefore become wary of informing the police that they have participated in such activity, for fear that they will be publicly stigmatized or subjected to police investigation themselves. The only time S&M can be problematic is when someone does not listen to their partner when they withdraw their consent and ask for the session to end. Individuals will not stop engaging in S&M simply because the state says so, but victims of over-aggressive partners will lose recourse or protection under the law if they try to approach the police about such an incident. Where an S&M session goes awry, victims of an abuse of consent will have to admit to engaging in a criminal act. In the same way prostitutes have no real protection from assault and rape due to the criminality of their acts, victims of assault and rape in S&M are no longer protected. The opposition may attempt to claim that there will be a clear distinction between a sadistic “criminal” and a submissive “victim” whenever a complaint is raised. Many sadomasochistic relationships are based around fluctuating and interchangeable roles. Both partners may engage in sadistic acts at different times."}
{"id": 2076, "content": "It is sufficient for the decriminalization of sadomasochism that each participant is aware of the hazards inherent in the fetishes they will be exploring and consents to them. No law prohibits people from refusing to wear a condom during sexual intercourse, notwithstanding the peril of infection. Furthermore, all cases where an individual withdraws their consent for the activity can be arbitrated and prosecuted like every other situation of consensual sex where an individual withdraws consent and their partner does not respect that wish. The police and courts will investigate it in the same way and will prosecute those who commit rape under the guise of S&M just as they prosecute those who commit rape under the guise of consensual intercourse."}
{"id": 2077, "content": "Meaningful consent requires both that the person is informed and of age when consenting, but also requires the ability to withdraw consent at any point in time. Sadomasochism does not afford this crucial requisite of consent to the individual, and therefore no individual can legitimately and fully consent to the act. Safe words are ludicrously impractical. Their utility is dependent upon their actually being agreed and committed to memory in advance and their declaration being heeded by the individuals who are under the influence of intense sexual desire. The passive ‘victim’ might be subject to the physical constraints, characteristic of bondage, that make speech or even flight impossible. It might be difficult to distinguish between an injunction to cease and an exclamation of pain, which presumably is a relatively regular occurrence. Even where a number of individuals are able to demonstrate that their sadomasochistic encounters are conducted on a safe, regulated and consensual basis, it is not possible to give a concurrent guarantee that S&M is  generally  safe and cannot be used to perpetrate rape or abuse. The existence of a group of individuals able to interact safely in a sadomasochistic context does not mean that S&M does not present a risk to the wider population, nor that ordinary individuals are not excessively vulnerable to harm when engaged in S&M activities."}
{"id": 2078, "content": "A distinction should be made between socially legitimatized recreational violence- such as rugby or boxing- and stigmatized recreational violence- such as S&M . Rugby, ice hockey or motor racing must, of necessity, occur in public. Each of these events incorporates large numbers of competitors and is regulated by a referee. It is not possible for a Rugby player to be forced to play a match against his will, nor will he be prevented from leaving the field if he is injured or feels threatened. Indeed, referees can force players to withdraw if they believe they are at risk. Where violent sports events take place without any form of official sanction or oversight, their size makes them easy to detect, and legal principles such as negligence and ineffective consent make them easy to prosecute. Society permits violent public events such as rugby, while condemning violent private entertainments such as S&M partly because consent, capacity and safety are much easier to determine in a public context. In short, individuals are allowed to consent to the risks inherent in participating in a rugby match because the state- and society at large- is satisfied that sufficient safeguards exist to ensure that players’ consent is informed – that the risks they will be exposed to are foreseeable. This level of control and accountability cannot be generally guaranteed within individuals’ private sexual relationships. Although S&M practices, when properly conducted, do not carry a risk of permanent harm and are not likely to result in non-consensual activity, oversight of participant’s behavior is simply not possible. Sexuality is inherently private and individual sexual acts are closed off from public discussion."}
{"id": 2079, "content": "The failures of the prison system are tolerated within political culture and by the public, partly because the privations of the prison environment are seen as a suitable punishment for criminal behaviour. Deprivation of liberty and the emptiness of criminal life are seen as retribution for criminals’ dishonest or violent activities. Politicians dare not confront the damaging effects of imprisonment for fear of being labelled as “soft” on crime. There is greater political cache to be gained from introducing policies that prolong prison terms, and remove judges’ discretion to order non custodial sentences. Novel approaches to the problem of criminality are seen as signs of political weakness. The use of monitored corporal punishment will keep offenders who have not committed serious crimes out of the prison system. At a nominal rate of five lashes for every year of incarceration, flogging will serve as a clear demonstration of societal disapproval, satisfying popular conceptions of retributive “justice”. Once the need to punish is satisfied, policy makers will be free to institute new rehabilitation schemes that address the root causes of criminal behaviour; these schemes can be set up without sacrificing political capital or appearing to prioritise the rights of criminals over victims or the public."}

The majority of western liberal democracies are party to inter-governmental and supranational agreements that expressly forbid states from using torture or degrading or inhuman punishments in any capacity. The mark of a modern, liberal state is that it uses authority and engagement rather than raw power to protect its citizens. The use of force or power by the state and its agents is harder to regulate and costlier to compensate when it is misapplied. Liberal democracies, apart from being agents of realpolitik, are also aspirational bodies that should strive to reflect and adhere to the values they were created to defend. Arbitrary, coercive force and violence is one of the core harms that a state must guard against. Violence is said to be the preserve of criminals and those acting against the values of society. Therefore, as an aspirational body, the state should hold itself to a higher standard of behaviour than such individuals. Violence, as most liberal constitutions make clear, should only ever be employed by the state as a last resort. Where a state has the means to do so, even if those means are costly or politically contentious, it should endeavour to achieve peace and order within its own borders without wielding power. At its broadest, the liberal democratic ideology holds that the rights and autonomy of individual citizens should be only be infringed in order to protect the rights and autonomy of other citizens. This principle would be violated if the state resorted to corporal sentencing as a way of satisfying a mob-like demand for visible and harsh criminal sentencing. No citizen of a liberal democracy has a right to demand that another citizen, criminal or not, should be subjected to unnecessary pain and suffering by the state."}

As the communication is confidential, such confession will not be informed to the court and the attorney would not be exposed for their lies.

It does not make sense for a legal system to on one hand place so much emphasis on evidence and lock away documents which will contain a vast array of empirical evidence with the other.

{"id": 2085, "content": "Most obviously it seems unnecessary for there to be attorney client privilege when the defendant’s interests cannot be adversely affected. For example when the confidential information just does not incriminate the client himself but it might clear somebody else, or when the client is dead. Few people will be discouraged from being candid with their lawyers if there is merely the possibility that the communications may be disclosed after their death. In addition there are situations where the client’s interest may indeed be hurt but where this should be outweighed by some other very important public interest. In other words perhaps there should be ‘necessity’ or ‘public interest’ or ‘in the interests of justice’ balancing exceptions to the privilege. This would be the case when public safety is at risk, for example if the client holds some very vital information but is not willing to disclose it to anyone other than his lawyer. In such cases the courts should weigh up and balance the client’s interests against society’s and make the decision accordingly rather than rigidly sticking to attorney-client privilege."}

This is good for all those involved in the transaction.

{"id": 2097, "content": "One of the reasons why poverty does not get eliminated is that it is governments who provide the subsidies that are intended to do just that. Many countries spend their money for subsidies poorly, for example in Indonesia before fuel subsidies were combined with cash subsidies in 2005 the top income decile received more than five times the amount of fuel subsidy as the bottom decile making the policy highly regressive despite it being politically sold as a subsidy to the poor. When the government provides lots of different subsidies for different things; fuel, food, housing etc., and especially when some of them are universal, it is clear that it will never be possible to distribute the money fairly on the basis of need."}
{"id": 2098, "content": "The beauty of direct cash transfers is that it simply adds a new income stream but this is also its Achilles heel. Providing direct cash transfers will create dependency upon the transfers and reduce the incentive to be earning money from elsewhere. There are several reasons for this. The advantage of in-kind transfers is that they help avoid expectations of long term assistance or the state essentially providing everything."}
{"id": 2099, "content": "Governments have accepted, in documents like the universal declaration of human rights, that one of their primary roles is to provide a basic standard of living for their citizens. When the state simply hands out some money this responsibility is not fulfilled. The state is simply leaving the poor to fend for themselves with a little extra money. Governments provide subsidies in kind or for specific products and services for a reason; those are the things that are necessities rather than luxuries. If money is transferred directly then the person who is getting the money can use the government’s money on anything. Some may use it on the things the government was providing before but others will spend the money badly on tobacco, alcohol, or drugs. Subsidies however can be targeted at the things that the poor really need. This means the state provides subsidies for food, free or cheap housing and healthcare, fuel for cooking and heating etc."}
{"id": 2100, "content": "With subsidies at least the government knows what their money is being spent on. This is not the case with cash; it just gets taken and can be spent on anything. As already mentioned the most obvious examples are where the individual uses the money they are given on drugs or other harmful products not what they need. Yet there are times where individuals may simply not have their own best interests at heart for various reasons, particularly because they know no better. This does not just happen in economic situations but also in public heath. For example development agencies know that cooking on open fires in homes leads to thousands of deaths every year and is costly in terms of fuel. So thousands of clean smokeless stoves have been given out yet they are not being used despite them being cheaper to run and potentially a life saver."}

Bearing in mind the messy collapses of some dictatorships, a democracy may be a more stable form of government over the long term . Only democracies can create a stable legal framework. The rule of law ensures all of society has access to justice and the government acts within the law. Free and fair elections act as a bulwark against social unrest and violence. Economic freedoms and human rights protection also have positive effects on economies. Private property rights, for example, encourage productivity and innovation so that one has control of the fruits of their labour. It has been argued by Acemolgu and Robinson in their book  Why Nations Fail?

Ethiopia has already constructed nine dams which produce more energy than the country consumes . A significant disadvantage of these dams is that droughts can lower their energy output which, combined with lower river levels for nine months of the year, results in the dams being ineffective . The Ethiopian government has already announced plans for a geothermal plant being built for 2018 to offset the disadvantages of the current dams . The geothermal plant costs $0.7 billion less than the hydroelectric dam, and the company constructing it claim it will produce twice as much energy as the hydroelectric dam when the latter is at its peak . It would be more viable, therefore, to invest in thermal energy rather than another hydroelectric project."}
{"id": 2110, "content": "Natural Flow Theory (NTF) is the concept that every riparian user (land touching the water) has a right to the water unaltered and undiminished . Dams tend not to disrupt water flow directly, however water use and evaporation from the large reservoir upstream from the dam could reduce the flow of the Blue Nile. In turn, this could affect downstream countries. Evaporation from the Aswan dam in Ethiopia amounts to around 14 billion cubic metres . The GERD will face similar problems, meaning that the downstream countries will have a reduced water flow. The reservoir will also become a tempting target for large agricultural businesses as well. These companies, many of them foreign, have taken part in ’land grabbing’ to secure water before for large irrigation projects  and could potentially tap in to the large reservoir. A similar example is the Colorado River, where dams and irrigation projects have reduced the flow of the river and impacted heavily on the river delta . These threats to the Blue Nile’s river flow demonstrate the likelihood of decreased access to water in the downstream countries, violating the major principle of NTF."}
{"id": 2111, "content": "Any treaty that seeks to ban cyber-attacks would simply be an attempt to cement the position of the most powerful countries at the expense of weaker ones. This is because cyber-attacks are, like terrorism, weapons that can be used by anyone to attack a much bigger target. To launch a cyber-attack there is little need for training, only a small amount of comparatively cheap equipment (to military hardware at any rate), and an internet connection. This makes it ideal for poor nations to maintain cyber warfare as a credible threat to their bigger neighbours while their neighbours threaten them conventionally with their bigger militaries. We have seen before arms treaties that are fundamentally biased in favour of a small group of powerful states. Most notable is the Nuclear non-proliferation treaty where there are five recognised nuclear weapons states who are allowed the horrific weapons and everyone else is banned from having them. This discrimination was accepted as a result of the agreement that the nuclear weapons states would eventually disarm. It has not happened so leaving a troubled treaty system that appears to be regularly flouted."}

It should also act as a deterrent to future violations; it may not reduce conflict but will encourage states to keep a tighter rein on their militaries.

It is simply untrue to suggest that journalists report the ‘unvarnished truth’ with no regard to its ramifications. Where a particular fact or image is likely to cause offence or distress, it is routine to exercise self-censorship – it’s called discretion and professional judgement . Indeed, the news outlets that fail to do so are the ones most frequently and vociferously denounced by the high-minded intelligentsia who so frequently argue that broadcasting issues such as this constitutes free speech.

This is likely to lead to an increase in hostility from the taxpayers who do not understand why they are being punished, towards the people of former colonies.

Following the seminal work of John Maynard Keynes during the Great Depression of the 1930s, it has become widely accepted within the economics profession that a certain amount of interventionist national government policy is essential to maintaining a proper balance between the twin economic evils of unemployment and inflation. Just as judicious national anticyclical policy is beneficial to national economies, so too a judicious world anticyclical policy, as implemented by a functioning world government, would be beneficial to the world economy. A world government would also improve the overall functioning of the global economy by means of regularizing various circumstances of international economic interaction (for example, in the area of patents and copyrights), and by working to reduce various trade impediments (such as tariffs and quotas) imposed by national governments."}

As the mutual accusations and recriminations go on and on, the problems are left to fester. If a world government existed, it might muster sufficient respect and possess sufficient authority to enable the nations to arrive at a workable consensus on how to share equitably the short-term costs and inconveniences necessary to securing long-term sustainability of resources and preservation of environmental quality."}
{"id": 2121, "content": "A world government would give people a higher focus for their political loyalties than their respective nation-states, and thus facilitate the development of a higher degree of cosmopolitanism than is possible under the sovereign nation-state system. This would benefit the practical operations and effectiveness of the world government. The greater the sense of community among the citizens of a polity, the higher the effectiveness of the polity’s government, and the higher the effectiveness of the polity’s government, the greater the sense of community among its citizens. This suggests an interactive, snowballing relationship over time between the sense of community of the citizens of the world federation, and the efficiency and effectiveness of its practical operations. From relatively low sense of community and low effectiveness in its early stages, over many years of gradual evolution, the world federation would eventually achieve a very high level of community spirit and practical effectiveness."}
{"id": 2122, "content": "A world government would add another layer of bureaucracy to a world which is already laboring under a heavy burden of bureaucracy. Were a world government bureaucracy to be added to what already exists at the national, regional and local levels, it would be accurate to describe the situation as “bureaucratic suffocation” or “bureaucratic strangulation.” Of their nature, bureaucracies stifle creative thought and innovation. A world government would be subject to so many conflicting viewpoints and attitudes that its bureaucracy would necessarily have to impose an overwhelming deluge of requirements, restrictions, forms and reports on the citizens. The citizens would be effectively hamstrung, and be (figuratively speaking) more or less trussed up in straitjackets. So even if—by some remote chance—the world state did not immediately degenerate into a brutal police state, its massive bureaucracy would in some ways constitute a virtual police state. The problem of bureaucracy alone argues against a world state."}
{"id": 2123, "content": "Some eminent international relations authorities have argued that no feasible transition path of a benign nature exists from the present situation of national sovereignty, to a world government. A nuclear world war might change this situation: such a war might so shock and horrify the global human population that it will turn to world govern­ment in desperation. This outcome is possible, of course, but it is equally possible that after a nuclear Armageddon had occurred, the scattered and demoralized survivors would be neither capable of nor interested in world government. Quite likely the surface of the world would become sub-divided into a host of autonomous principalities presided over by dictatorial war lords. It would seem that in a post-nuclear war world, there would be just as much chance of severe political fragmentation taking place as there is of further political consolidation."}
{"id": 2124, "content": "Offshoring spurs the development of poorer states. Offshoring relies on the existence of a basic industrial base and certain essential forms of state infrastructure, including an education system. These facilities are likely to be partially or wholly absent in a developing economy. The readily available capital that is located in the developed world, along with the example provided by other developing states that have successfully engaged in offshoring projects incentivises investment in service infrastructure and high quality education. Many contemporary development strategies focus on developing a state’s industrial and agricultural sectors before its service economy. Expansion of developing states agricultural sectors is already proving to be a politically contentious issue, thanks to the generous and entrenched subsidies that farmers in the developed world are provided with. Resource extraction from developing states is not possible without ceding control of land and hiring of employees to wealthy supermajor oil firms, which exercise an effective monopoly over skilled geologists, miners, scientists and oil drilling experts. Under these circumstances, a conservative approach to development is likely to take an extremely long time to substantially improve economic prosperity and living standards within a poor state. However, an immediate focus on the service sector may allow a state to “leap frog” these developmental stages . Offshoring provides businesses within a developing state with access to foreign markets far larger than those in their native economy may contain. This will allow offshoring businesses to take advantage of economies of scale and capital inflow in order to develop with greater speed. A state’s political culture will also stand to benefit from increased outsourcing. Offshore businesses will demand increasingly accountable, predictable and non-arbitrary forms of national governance. A level of reliability and foreseeability is essential in any system of civil law; so is a restrained, stable government that is prevented from using its power to expropriate private assets or spend tax revenue capriciously."}
{"id": 2125, "content": "Companies that rely on directly hiring new employees to cover their back-office, estates and maintenance needs will not run the risk that the cost efficiency of those services might suffer as a result of union action or state regulation of pay. Companies that rely on outsourced offshored labour to fill back-office and administrative roles expose themselves to the risk that those relationships will be undermined, damaged or abused by legal disputes or negotiation failures. When a dispute develops between a business and a worker that it employs directly, the consequences of that dispute- in terms of lost productivity and lost profits- will usually be limited by the nature of the role that the employee occupies. It will be relatively cheap for a multinational firm to settle a dispute with a sacked cleaner. In addition, the loss of a single cleaner from a large facilities department will not compromise a company’s ability to do business. The situation is quite different when the services and productivity of an entire company department are dependent on a relationship with an outsourcing firm. The collapse of the relationship between the media firm BskyB and its outsourcing partner EDS resulted in combined legal costs of $70,000,000 and a court case that lasted for almost five months . A dispute over the terms of a contract or a crisis within the state in which an offshore outsourcing service is based can cut a company off from the workers and systems that it has hired. If a company has transferred all responsibility for its payroll or customer support operations to an offshore location, it will be completely paralysed by disagreements or emergencies of this type. Ordinarily, the equity value and insurance liabilities of businesses could only be directly threatened by large scale union action, a failed product launch or the departure of a senior manager. However, the web of high dependency relationships that a business must enter into to remain competitive has now grown. By decentralising their authority and giving up their right to regulate relationships with its labour force on a one-to-one basis, businesses have exposed themselves to a greater amount of risk."}

When looking at regulation in health care, the relationship between private healthcare provision, efficiency and quality is variable.

Gender-based violence is a key concern that can be reduced by involving men in family planning decisions. If they buy into having fewer children then they are less likely to object to using contraception and condoms – something that has other potential benefits such as preventing STDs. The United Nations Development Fund for Women has found that one in four women is abused during pregnancy, teaching men about reproductive health and family planning can prevent this from happening. The intervention is changing men’s attitude and behaviors ."}
{"id": 2136, "content": "By including men fast action can be taken to control the size, and growth, of families. The patriarchal power structures mean men have a key voice in household decisions. Therefore the involvement of men in family planning is enabling perceptions of what the family should be to change. The cost of raising a family is realized, and intervening methods are being used to have fewer children. Family planning means planning how one can cope with having a child – mentally, emotionally, financially, and physically, and sensitizing couples as to what kind of life standard they want. With the young generation of Ugandans a new culture of a smaller family can emerge . Men often have limited knowledge about family planning so it is necessary that they are included in learning and the transfer of knowledge (Kaida et al, 2005).

A policy of prioritizing transplants for donors would massively increase the proportion of donors from the status quo of (at best) just over 30% {Confirmed Organ Donors}. Given the number of people who die under circumstances that render many of their organs useless, the rate of donor registration must be as high as possible. The overwhelming incentive that this policy would create to register may well eliminate the scarcity for certain organs altogether; a bonus benefit of this would mean that for organs where the scarcity was eliminated, this policy would not even need to make good on its threat of denial of organs to non-donors (and even if this happened for every organ and thus reduced the incentive to register as a donor, the number of donors could only fall as far as until there was a scarcity again, thus reviving the incentive to donate until the rate of donation reaches an equilibrium with demand.)"}
{"id": 2144, "content": "Reciprocity is a basic moral principle: afford others the good treatment you yourself would like to receive. In most cases, it is a hypothetical; one must place oneself in the other person’s position even though one will never actually be in their place. However, how donor and non-donors are treated when they themselves are in need is a situation in which reciprocity becomes a practical reality. This principle of reciprocity suggests that people who are willing to donate their organs more deserve to receive organs when they need them. And there is good reason to believe in reciprocity. Those who would flaunt this principle are basically stating that they expect something of other people that they themselves are unwilling to do; this is a position that is either incoherent, or based on the unjustified premise that oneself is more objectively valuable than other people. The concept of desert has a foundational role in our society. For example, innocent people deserve not to be put in prison, even if it would be useful to frame and make an example of an innocent person in order to quell a period of civil unrest."}
{"id": 2145, "content": "Organ donation, in all its forms, saves lives. More to the point, it saves lives with almost no loss to the donor. One obviously has no material need for one’s organs after death, and thus it does not meaningfully inhibit bodily integrity to incentivize people to give up their organs at this time. If one is registered as an organ donor, every attempt is still made to save their life {Organ Donation FAQ}. The state is always more justified in demanding beneficial acts of citizens if the cost to the citizen is minimal. This is why the state can demand that people wear seatbelts, but cannot conscript citizens for use as research subjects. Because there is no good reason not to become an organ donor, the state ought to do everything in its power to ensure that people do so."}
{"id": 2146, "content": "Most formulations of this policy involve assessing donor status on the basis of whether the patient was a registered organ donor prior to needing an organ. Thus, a sick person could find themselves in the tortuous situation of sincerely regretting their past decision not to donate, but having no means to atone for their past act. To visit such a situation upon citizens not only meaningfully deprives them of the means to continue living, it subjects them to great psychological distress. Indeed, they are not only aware that their past passive decision not to register as a donor has doomed them, but they are constantly told by the state that this is well and just."}
{"id": 2147, "content": "For the state to make organ donation mandatory is rightly seen as beyond the pale of what society would tolerate. This is because the right to the integrity of one’s body, including what is done with its component parts after death, must be held in the highest respect {UNDHR – Article 3 re security of person}. One’s body is one’s most foundational possession. Creating a system that effectively threatens death to anyone who refuses to donate part of their body is only marginally different from making it outright mandatory. The state’s goal is in effect the same: to compel citizens to give up their organs for a purpose the government has deemed socially worthwhile. This is a gross violation of body rights."}
{"id": 2148, "content": "Many major religions, such as some forms of Orthodox Judaism {Haredim Issue}, specifically mandate leaving the body intact after death. To create a system that aims to strongly pressure people, with the threat of reduced priority for life-saving treatment, to violate their religious beliefs violates religious freedom. This policy would put individuals and families in the untenable position of having to choose between contravene the edicts of their god and losing the life of themselves or a loved one. While it could be said that any religion that bans organ donation would presumably ban receiving organs as transplants, this is not actually the case; some followers of Shintoism and Roma faiths prohibit removing organs from the body, but allow transplants to the body."}
{"id": 2149, "content": "Young people express their sexuality as part of their development to adulthood. It is not having sex that is a problem, but having unsafe sex or hurting people through sexual choices. Refusing to promote safe sex would mean not moving with the times. Just because schools do not promote safe sex does not mean that adolescents will not experiment with sex. They will already be exposed to sexual imagery and ideas of sex so it is necessary that they are taught properly how to remain safe. Schools may also want to talk about abstinence at the same time; it is a way of keeping sexually safe. However schools have to recognise that the majority of pupils are unlikely to stick to abstinence regardless of how much the school promotes it. It is therefore necessary for the school to also promote and educate about safe sex."}
{"id": 2150, "content": "The internet provides a vast amount of easily accessible information about sex, of varying degrees of quality. Most children in the west now have access to the internet and are therefore likely to have access to this information on sex, or at least educational materials on sex even if the child’s access to the internet is controlled. Given that it is impossible to prevent children from accessing this information if they really want to, it makes sense to present it to them in an organised and accurate fashion. Rather than allowing children to find information on their own through what may well be unreliable resources it is necessary that they should get good reliable information. That this information when there is safe sex education comes from the school means that the children know that they information is reliable. They can then use this information to help them decide how reliable any further information they may find from other sources is."}
{"id": 2151, "content": "With the age of consent being 16 and with young people being able to vote at 18, it does not make sense for parents to have control over whether their children attended sex education classes right up until the age of 19 or whenever they finish full time schooling. The age of consent means that there is clearly a need to be taught about sex from that age of consent. This is something that cannot be guaranteed to happen in all individual households if left to the parents whereas it can be ensured in schools."}
{"id": 2152, "content": "Sex education leads to experimentation and early intercourse, and indirectly encourages promiscuity. The most moral form of Sex Education says ‘you shouldn’t do this, but we know you are,’ thus pushing children to consider their sexual existence before they need to or indeed should. Thus sex education’s message is invariably confused – on the one hand, by saying ‘here are the perils of teen sex – so don’t do it,’ and on the other hand, ‘here is how to have teen sex safely.’ Less moral forms start by saying, ‘the best form of a relationship is a loving, constant relationship’ and then say, here are the ways to use protection if you’re not in such a relationship’ – a logic which presumes children are in sexual relationships to begin with. The justification for this is that ‘adolescents know all about sex’ – an idea pushed in our permissive society so much it’s almost a truism – but contrary to that bland generalisation, many children don’t do these things early, don’t think about these things – they actually have childhoods, and these lessons stir up confusion, misplaced embarrassment or even shame at slower development. They also encourage children to view their peers in a sexualised context. The openness with which education tells students to treat sex encourages them to ask one another the most personal questions (have you lost your virginity? Inhibitions are broken down not just by peer pressure, but by the classroom. As pro-sex education people love to point out, children develop in their own time – but that means that some are learning about this too early, as well as ‘too late.’ We in society are guilty of breaking the innocence of childhood, earlier and earlier – and these lessons are a weapon in the forefront of that awful attack on decent life."}
{"id": 2153, "content": "Sex education informs children about sex, and then invites them to make a choice. But as demonstrated all the time, children are bad decision-makers, often choosing what is bad for them. That is why adult society often needs to decide for them – what they should eat, what they should watch on T.V., when they are mature enough to be able to choose whether or not to drink or smoke. Surely sex is just as important as those things – just as dangerous, just as potentially destructive. The abdication of our responsibility in the sexual arena is shameful; we should be unafraid to simply tell children this is something they cannot do, aren’t mature enough to consent to yet – a responsibility we seem to shrink from even though it is reflected by the stated aim of society enshrined in the law of the age of consent. Lessons implicitly lauding the pleasures of intercourse are entirely contrary to that aim."}
{"id": 2154, "content": "This is none of the state’s business. Teaching this subject en masse in a classroom reduces it to biological notions, group embarrassment and crude jokes. Furthermore, children have never needed this from the state: left alone, they learn from their family and surroundings and grow naturally into adults without the state’s involvement. Few things are responsible for parental disaffection with education more than the teaching of sex and sexuality in ways contrary to their wishes. Parents have a right to determine the moral environment in which their children develop and this is a huge intrusion into that right. That moral environment has been manipulated again and again over the last forty years by a liberal teaching establishment set on undermining traditional values and beliefs. Sex education has been a prime weapon in that social engineering. That tool should be taken away from teachers, who as a body have proven themselves undeserving of it. As for the tedious idea that children somehow need the nanny state to look after their sexuality – who knows children and their needs better than parents? Schools are responsible for so much that is wrong with our children, and by giving them free licence to delve into students’ sexuality, things become so much worse, blurring the line between teacher, adviser, confidante, and sometimes in extremes, between teacher and lover – an abuse of power that bringing sex into the classroom makes so much easier."}
{"id": 2155, "content": "Sex education classes for those under the age of consent undermines the law. It says, ‘don’t do this – but given that you are, do this, this and this.’ This sends a terrible message about the law – that breaking it isn’t serious, that authority (as represented by teachers) tacitly approves of that illegality, will tolerate it and even encourage it. Sex education fails to tell our children clearly what is right and what is wrong. And remember that these are children, who need clear boundaries to guide their behaviour, and who may not understand the subtleties appreciated by liberal educationalists. In any case, so few teachers want to teach this subject that the quality of teaching is awful. Those that do end up teaching it are often the oddest characters in the teaching establishment. Many teachers happy to ‘cover’ other subjects are uniquely embarrassed by this one, or object to it on moral grounds and will not do so, leaving it to the most liberal members of staff."}

Young noted in a 1988 ruling , there is no evidence of a fatality resulting from the misuse of cannabis. Indeed the Dutch government currently permits doctors regulated by its Ministry of Health and Welfare to prescribe cannabis to their patients. Further, the Dutch state has licensed a pharmaceutical firm to provide cannabis of a guaranteed level of purity to pharmacies and medical professionals.

Seemingly logical but flawed theories linking the use of “soft” drugs to later use of “harder” varieties (cocain, amphetamins) have often been used both to justify and to promote drugs legislation. The apparent sense of these arguments belies the fact that they have been repeatedly disproven . Lurid, prurient portrayals of the catastrophic consequences of narcotics use in the mass media are frequently used to back up arguments that drugs- even cannabis- are so dangerous that even carefully controlled medical applications are unacceptably risky. It is clearly the case that when any substance has a proven medical benefit it should be available for prescription. Legislation already exists in most countries to contain the possibility of misuse of prescribed drugs. However, it is clearly the case that politicians are avoiding this issue not because there is medical doubt on the matter but because they are incapable of reaching a logical conclusion for fear of hysterical – and easy – headlines.

{"id": 2158, "content": "If the drug were made available, it would need to be grown somewhere, stored somewhere and sold somewhere. Increased supervision of pharmacies and users would be required, in order to guard against the possibility that medical cannabis might be sold on for recreational purposes. Although other pharmaceuticals have narcotics effects, none has the marketability, or market share of cannabis. Many legal types of pharmaceuticals already form the basis of criminal empires and this move would exacerbate that. Moreover, the increased visibility and mobility of cannabis within the economy will make it easier for determined criminals to hide or obscure the origins of cannabis produced illegally. Individual citizens will be less likely to consider cannabis use that they are victim to as being illegal. It will become harder and more expensive for the police to enforce restrictions on the use and production of cannabis for recreational purposes. It has been well argued that “drugs are not a threat to society because they are illegal; they are illegal because they are a threat to society” . Legalization in any form will be misconstrued and the health effects will be damaging . Even if side proposition can demonstrate that the health effects of cannabis are negligible, the risk of incentivizing increased production of cannabis in foreign territories and increased trade and transfer of cannabis at home is simply too high for the state to accept.

A government sanction on a drug with a proven tendency to effect memory and other neurological functions would still hold open the door to other, more dangerous, drugs as a form of rebellion.

An example is PepsiCo’s “Smart Spot” program that is intended to help consumers identify healthier products – products the company developed as a consequence of consumer pressure for healthier drinks that contain less sugar.

{"id": 2171, "content": "Photoshopping women’s bodies is not just morally wrong, it can cause real physical harm.

In the vast majority of cases they will find themselves wanting. Many who compare themselves are likely to suffer psychologically. If young women who have a normal body compare themselves to these images they are likely to suffer from lower self-esteem. The media is a powerful influence. There will be those who attempt to match these unnaturally thin bodies leading to conditions like anorexia  and other eating disorders.

It will encourage positive behaviours; more realism, more body diversity, and healthier attitudes to the female body. With airbrushing banned the media will be forced to show a wider range which then gives a better idea of what is normal.

These are doing the same thing; making a photo more attractive through editing."}
{"id": 2175, "content": "Airbrushing and photoshopping of women’s bodies does have upsides. The ability to remove blemishes, or make someone a little thinner in photos helps broaden the possibilities of potential models who might not fit the image of being very thin. Being able to make slight changes means that there are a considerably larger number of people who can pursue their dreams of being involved in the modelling industry. For those who are not professional models but get the opportunity to be in a magazine or similar it provides the opportunity to look good, or on a par with the models. This can therefore have considerable psychological benefit for those who are shown as they know they will be looking their best."}
{"id": 2176, "content": "There are advantages to allowing photoshopping of women’s bodies. The women involved may wish to remove blemishes and make themselves looks slightly thinner. Importantly the use of software to do this potentially allows almost anyone to be shown how they want to appear. People with some blemish that may rule them out of being in the media can be photoshopped thus opening up the industry. The flipside of this is that if a ban is put in place those young women who might have had opportunities in the industry will be ruled out. The media is unlikely to change immediately to wanting images of a more normal body image. This means that if photoshopping is ruled out the only option is to use really thin models. As a result, anyone who wants to be a model will have to be starving themselves to achieve the image needed to get ahead."}

The pressure on people, especially young people, to conform to a certain stereotype of physical perfection is astonishing and comes from many sources – music, magazines and the celebrity culture endemic in the media. It is notable that there is a well studied correlation between mass media consumption and eating disorders and fears of poor body image. This is nearly always untrue.

People can be grown up about this, and where they're children, their parents can be grown up about this. The entire health and education system already exists to tell us to eat our greens and cycle to work; for those people who chose not to do so, they have a range of diet option and advertising tell them what those options are. The government regularly runs healthy eating advertising campaigns, and they often focus on obesity such as the Change4Life campaign, so there is plenty of opportunity to get the other side across. Prop seems to think that consumers are idiots, nobody believes that a diet for a couple of weeks will make them look like a super model any more than buying a pair of speedos will.

Equally diets are a mainstay of teen and women's magazines and a fairly central pillar of lifestyle sections of newspapers. Even so called 'quality' papers endlessly talk about lifestyles issues such as how they don't work and everyone would be better off retiring to a country manor in Shropshire for Swedish massage and a diet of organic barley. Unless prop is talking about starting to ban books or shut down entire sections (and profitable sections at that) of publishing companies then it is difficult to see how this measure will have any real affect."}

Diets are a response, one of many as Prop is keen to point out, to a serious problem that only government can begin to address. From before we are old enough to walk most people in the developed world are hooked on a fat-, sugar- and salt-rich diet. People will still use diets because of the gaps, such as the web, already mentioned however it doesn't require government to say anything as risky as “You're fat because you eat rubbish and don't move around much” to the electorate – or worse still, “Your children are fat because you can't put your foot down and tell them they can't have another choc-ice or more chips”.

Kraft eliminated trans fats from its Oreo cookies, with little public perception of any change in taste. Denmark imposed a national ban on trans fats with which even McDonald's has complied. Since trans fats are not irreplaceable, objections for the sake of consumer freedom are also unconvincing. As with lead added to paint, trans fats are unnecessary additions to products that can cause significant harm. Most people remain ignorant of the presence of trans-fats in their food, and of their effects. In this area the ban on trans fats differs from restrictions placed on the sale of alcohol and tobacco and so the two kinds of bans are not comparable. Not only are trans fats easy to substitute in foodstuffs, without impairing quality or taste, the presence of trans-fats is hard to detect. It is all-but impossible for informed and conscientious consumers to avoid buying and eating trans-fats. While banning cigarettes and alcohol mean banning an entire product category, banning the ingredient of trans fats means no such thing. Rather, it simply means that readily available replacement ingredients must be used in the preparation of the same foods. And, since these fatty replacements are widespread and cheaply available, food makers and consumers should have little difficulty making the adjustment to making and consuming the same, albeit slightly modified, foods."}

Carlie Irwin argues: “Since most of the big chains have already started the process of eliminating trans-fat from their food, the ban would be no big deal to them. But small, independent restaurants are another story. The potential ban has small restaurant owners sweating and nervously eyeing their deep fryers. As the St. Louis Business Journal points out, many small restaurant owners don’t have the ability to effectively and efficiently reformulate their menu items. So banning trans fat could mean that your favorite independently-owned fried chicken joint down the street will be shuttering its doors.”(17) Consequently, a trans-fat ban would breed legal exceptions and inconsistencies. For example, in Illinois bakeries were exempted from their ban because lawmakers knew that it would drive up their costs and hurt the bakeries specialty items. Many other small businesses would be similarly affected Restaurants and other specialty vendors who use trans-fat products on site would also be affected. Lawmakers then have a choice of either reducing the effect of the ban and including lots of bureaucratic exemptions or punishing these businesses."}

Many drugs can prevent or reduce the likelihood of a patient requiring surgery (for instance anti-cholesterol drugs can reduce the buildup of atheroma in blood vessels, which cause cardiovascular heart disease and strokes, thus reducing the likelihood of a heart bypass being required and improving any post-stroke rehabilitation). This not only saves money but is also better for patients. Surgery involves the risk of complications as well as taking time both directly and in post-operation rehabilitation. Also many degenerative conditions can be best treated by early intervention; if patients are aware of the drugs that are available at an early stage they are more likely to take them, thereby increasing their standard of living and reducing their long-term cost to state or private health cover providers."}

If things are made difficult for employers with HIV positive workers, then they are less likely in the future to employ people who (they suspect) are HIV positive. Employers must be listened to in this debate – in many HIV-stricken countries, they’re the last thing between a semi-functioning society and complete economic and social collapse.

Especially when there is not just one foreign substance, but let us say 24 of them given to a human body over a period of time, there is increased risk that at least one of the substances may cause damage to the body. The drugs can damage an individual for life. The case of Robert Fletcher can be used as an example (reported by the Telegraph): “The seizure occurred ten days after the vaccination. Robert is severely disabled as a result of vaccination. Mrs Fletcher said: “Robert is nearly 19 but mentally he is like a 14-month-old toddler. He can’t stand unaided and he is doubly incontinent. He can’t speak except to say ‘Hi, Mum’ or ‘Hi, Daddy’.”  Robert Fletcher is not the only one with such severe symptoms and worse is that physicians never can be sure what the outcome will be.

The politicians, having the resources and time which they have to use, to get well equipped to make more informed decision on activities dangerous to the individual, others and the society. One of the principles in society therefore is that elected representatives have to make sure their citizens get the best possible protection in society. Even if this infringes on some of their rights. Alcohol for a long time has been kept because the government trusted the people; they would make responsible decisions regarding alcohol. However, each year, the society loses, on a 30 year based average, more than 75,000 individuals to alcohol related diseases or accidents. The government has a duty to protect those irresponsible citizens, because otherwise they will not be able to contribute to society to the extent they could without alcohol. And because the government does not know who is the one that will make a stupid decision that will engender their lives in the long run, for the sake of few individuals’, alcohol has to be banned for all. Therefore, because the government has been trusted with the duty to make informed decisions instead of the individuals and to protect the individual, it is right to allow them to ban alcohol if they believe it is very harmful."}

Such a society might have its benefits in a short term, but seen long term it has more unsatisfied individuals. With drinking alcohol responsibly no one is getting harmed; in many cases not even the individual, as it is actually beneficial for the health. A glass of wine per day is good for decreasing the risk of cancer and heart disease, scientists say. This is because the society has been made from the different individuals, which lead different lifestyles and therefore have very opposing opinions views on what freedom is. A society that is free and where individuals are happy is a society where individuals engage more and also give more back to the society. So if alcohol will make the people happy and then more productive, we should maintain status quo."}
{"id": 2196, "content": "By banning alcohol the government is searching for a quick way out of the problem of people excessively drinking, making bad decisions when under the influence of alcohol. Alcoholism and also drunk driving is a problem in many countries over the world. It has taken governments for over 30 years to decrease the number of drunk driver accidents, to decrease the number of drinkers in certain regions. This is a hard campaign battle, the government has to battle. According to a recent study, by the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, campaigns contribute to approximately 13 % of decrease in drinking through time. This is a number with which many governments are not satisfied as they are pouring a lot of money in the campaigns. Therefore for the government it seems maybe reasonable to prevent just all citizens from drinking. With this the government might be saying that the problem is fixed (because no one is allowed to drink alcohol anymore), but mainly it is just superficially solving it. As people’s mentality has not changed just through a law passing, they have created only more problematic users, they cannot target with campaigns and so do not impact the society.

While about 60 percent of the market was still in the hands of small, local enterprises, truly global players are steadily emerging and creating an even greater market. There are not good enough reasons for wreaking this havoc on the world economy. To ban alcohol would take away a major source of funding for public services.

In fact, research shows that a fat tax would produce only a marginal change in consumption – not the dramatic shift in public awareness the proponents of the fat tax are hoping for. The reason, LSE researchers believe, is simple: “those on the very poorest diets will continue to eat badly.” Other than the economic reasons for such behavior, it could be argued that is also a thing of habit and culture: fast fatty food is quick, accessible and tasty. It also seems that the fast fatty kind of food is fulfilling a specific need, a need for a quick, tasty and filling meal, something people consider worth paying good money for. The fight against obesity ought to be multifaceted, complex and well thought out – and a fat tax is none of those things. We should approach the issue with more cunning and introduce other programs: such as increasing the availability of healthy food by introducing healthy vending machines;  and, most importantly, proper education on the topic if we want to create lasting change."}

They are also the traditional environments for youth to continuously invent and reinvent themselves and therefore hold immense potential for behavior modification."}
{"id": 2200, "content": "Although it might be very tempting for the government to try and attack the problem of childhood obesity by attempting to change, in essence, the very choices our kids can make, this is the wrong way of going about doing it. The purpose of schools is education – the genesis of active and useful members of society. A large extent of what schools do is imprinting the ideas the society values. In most western countries those would be the ideas of fairness, democracy, freedom of expression, etc. The other side of the coin is the transference of knowledge, knowledge of mathematics, history, but also of biology, health and nutrition. We see thus that the proposed ban on specific choices one makes in school, whether be it choices regarding food or choices regarding the clothes one wears, the ideas one expresses, and so on, is truly meaningless in the existing concept of education. What the schools should be doing is putting more emphasis on getting the message of the importance of a healthy lifestyle across. Our kids should be taught that this lifestyle consists of more than just whether or not we chose to eat a hamburger and fries for lunch. In short, this ban falls short of truly educating the children about how important physical activity, balanced meals and indulging in moderation are. They should also focus on the importance of choice, since in the case of childhood obesity, making the right nutritional and lifestyle choices is of paramount importance. But they should also focus on the importance of choice for a society and how all should take responsibility for their choices in such a society."}
{"id": 2201, "content": "An important issue to consider in this topic is the constellation of incentives that actually got us to the place where we are at today. With the environment designed to incentivize improving schools’ performance on standardized tests, there is absolutely nothing that would motivate them to invest their very limited resources into non-core programs or subjects, such as PE and sports and other activities. An example cited in the paper is one high school in Beltsville, MD, which made $72,438.53 in the 1999-2000 school year through a contract with a soft drink company and another $26,227.49 through a contract with a snack vending company. The almost $100,000 obtained was used for a variety of activities, including instructional uses such as purchasing computers, as well as extracurricular uses such as the yearbook, clubs and field trips.

When a ban affects something that is a familiar part of everyday life that is generally regarded as benign, there is a risk that individuals may try to acquire the banned thing through other means. Having had their perspective in junk food defined partly by attractive, highly persuasive advertising, children are likely to adopt an ambivalent perspective on any attempt to restrict their dietary choices. The extreme contrast between the former popularity of vending machines in schools and the austere approach required by new policies may hamper schools’ attempts to convince pupils of the necessity and rationality of their decision. Even though schools may be able to coerce and compel their pupils to comply with disciplinary measures, they cannot stop children buying sweets outside of school hours. When rules at an Orange county school changed,  and the cafeteria got rid of its sweets, the demand was still up high, so that the school had to figure out a way to fix the situation. They created a “candy cart” – which now brings them income for sports equipment or other necessities. One of the pupils, Edgar Coker (18-year-old senior) explained that: “If I couldn’t buy it here, I’d bring it from home.” It is difficult to regulate junk food consumption through unsophisticated measures such as prohibition.

To benefit from resource wealth, money from the exploitation of mineral wealth and other sources needs to be reinvested in to the country’s economy and human capital . Investing in infrastructure and education can encourage long term growth. However a large amount of funds are pocketed by politicians and bureaucrats instead, hindering growth . Africa Progress Panel (APP) conducted a survey on five mining deals between 2010 and 2012 in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

This ability, reflecting effectively limitless capacity for providing textual information, meets the frequently heard desire for news without spin – routinely featured in research into people’s views on the press.

There are remarkably few areas of human progress and development – intellectual or societal – that have not caused ‘offence’ in some religious community somewhere. The best known is of course the Catholic Church’s forcing Galileo to recant his research in the 17th century. There is no need to seek out obscure fanatics for this purpose, mainstream religious figures seem to genuinely believe that the equality of women is still a difficult issue. To take just one example, in 2012 the supposedly moderate and progressive Anglican Communion is still unsure as to whether the ability to be a senior manager should be determined on the basis of somebody’s gender . With the exception of a handful that are in thrall to religious dominance, every nation state, company, charity, university and scholarly discipline has resolved this question and found itself better as a result. Most religions haven’t even started the process. Now that’s offensive. Women bishops: Anglicans still unsure over new wording."}

The electorate's increasing dependence on television, radio, and other mass media for news and information has made these expensive modes of communication indispensable instruments of effective political speech.” . This helps to show that nowadays, the effective communication of political ideas cannot be achieved without the expenditure of money.

However, when this hypothesis was scientifically tested, it turned out that in fact successful and popular candidates merely attracted more money, the same way they attract more volunteers, more endorsers, and more votes . Therefore, money, like an endorsement, is just a demonstrative way of throwing one’s weight behind a candidate one agrees with. Viewed in this context, money is not some sinister device for unpopular ideas to rise to the top against the will of the majority, but, like an endorsement, a form of speech supporting those ideas which are already popular enough to attract it.

If this is the case, then a leak’s harm would be limited to the layers of sediment nearby which would be unaffected by radiation. By comparison a leak outside might lead to animals nearby suffering from contamination. Further nuclear waste might reach water sources should there be a leak above ground, if it is raining heavily when the leak happens for example. Further, the other options available, such as above ground storage present a potentially greater danger, should something go wrong. This is because it is much easier for nuclear waste to leak radiation into the air. This is problematic because even a hint of radiation may well cause people to panic owing to the damaging and heavily publicised consequences of previous nuclear safety crises. As such, underground storage is safer both directly and indirectly. Focus and specialisation of this type is much more likely to avert a serious release of nuclear material from an underground facility than the broad and general approach that will be fostered by diverse and distinct above-ground storage solutions. The contributor may be referring to the ejection of irradiated dust and other particulates that has occurred when nuclear power stations have suffered explosive containment failures, but this is not comparable to the types of containment failures that might happen in facilities used to store spent nuclear fuel rods and medical waste. One of the more substantial risks presented by underground storage is release of nuclear material into a water source."}

So, if a company takes action to reduce its carbon emissions below the designated level, than it can make a profit. This is a powerful market incentive that is more likely to cause companies to invest money in finding ways to reduce their carbon emissions. A carbon tax, conversely, only provides the incentive of cutting costs, and does not offer this important profit motive. With cap-and-trade emissions are much more likely to be meaningfully reduced, specifically because the cap is static and as such nations can choose to raise and lower it as they wish. Within this mechanism, market prices would simply reflect the availability of credits. As such, nations can guarantee a reduction in carbon emissions just by reducing the number of credits in the market. Finally, because cap and trade affects all companies and minimises cost to them, it provides all companies with an incentive to work toward green technology. Under the status quo, where subsidies and research grants are paid to businesses researching emissions reduction technology, the government has to decide which companies are “best” at solving the ecological damage that industry causes. Other companies feel they don’t have to contribute because they are simply being taxed instead. We do not know where the next development in green technology will come from. As such a smaller impetus for everyone is likely to be better than a large impetus for a small number of companies who might not, in any event, be able to develop workable solutions to emissions problems."}

The urgency here comes from the fact that it will take time to establish new systems to work on this at an international level. One of the difficulties demonstrated by the experience of initial studies of climate change was that it needed to be conducted on a global scale, frequently involving complex and expensive modeling systems. There are several backstages to establishing this and the majority of relevant academics are currently working on prevention models rather than designing an entire new framework of prediction.

Practitioners learning by doing has worked perfectly well for most of history and produced, for example, the extraordinary works of the renaissance or classical art mostly without the benefit of a university degree.

Those students still need to sleep, study and socialize somewhere – in place of those who could have taken their places on Engineering, Medicine, Economics or similar courses had the space been available.

Some people are, by nature, not that kind of person – they may think in a short-term way or simply not be curious about the world. It also requires a level of intelligence which some people simply don’t have. These people will gain very little from spending time at university. In fact, at some (typically less prestigious) universities, dropout rates can be as high as 20%, meaning students will literally gain nothing. Partial blame for this lies with employers – the large number of graduates means a culture has developed among recruiters of using the presence or absence of a degree as a default filter for applicants; 78% of leading employers filter out anyone with less than a 2:1.

Thus, those children who are most vulnerable, i.e. those with inadequate home support structures, will find that they are unable to access the best schools as their parents may lack the desire or knowledge to find out which schools are the best in their area. Further, this problem will be exacerbated by the subsequent dearth of funding at the worst schools."}
{"id": 2281, "content": "The state funds education using taxes taken from everyone in society, not just those who have children. Therefore the state has a duty to benefit the whole of society, not just parents and children, when funding education. It is therefore entirely legitimate for the state to use schools to fulfil other societal purposes. A good example of this is the question of teaching citizenship in schools: it does not necessarily help children to pass exams, and so schools do not have a strong incentive to insure that children are taught it. However, it fulfils government goals of helping to ensure that people become functioning members of our democracy. When schools are privatised it becomes increasingly difficult for the government to ensure that such agendas are followed in schools."}
{"id": 2282, "content": "In order for a child’s misbehaviour to be successfully remedied, the child must receive a consistent message on what is appropriate both at home and at school. In many instances parents may condone behaviour that schools and teacher find unacceptable. In other instances, professionals at schools can aid parents in targeting specific behaviours to work on in a specific order in a program that integrates the child’s behaviour at both school and home. Moreover, uniform and consistent rewards and negative reinforcements from school and home are tremendously useful for helping rehabilitate a child’s behaviour. It’s understandable that parents, who must be with the children a majority of the time, sometimes may find it easier to simply give in and pacify the child and inadvertently award destructive behaviour. Therefore, a system of parental investment, as proposed here, will ensure that the parents have something riding on sticking to a disciplinary program as well, which ultimately aids the child. In the case of parents being penalized for criminal offenses by children, one can modify this argument to fit by noting that often juvenile facilities will use schools as part of a behavioural modification program, therefore the consistency noted above is still critical."}
{"id": 2283, "content": "Often, children who have been trapped in a cycle of lack of discipline and disciplinary problems tend not to care about their punishment. After all, there is only so much that an institution can do to discipline a child. Using this mechanism opens up a far more effective repertoire of discipline. More importantly, while the child may cease to regard any punishments handed down on him or her, often there will still be a desire to avoid actively harming the parents, which occurs under this system. In the psychology of a child, he or she may not fully internalize the effects on their future a shoplifting arrest may have. However, the thought of their parents being punished in such an offense may lead to the deterrence necessary to prevent such actions. In effect, the argument is that when punishments to the child him or herself fail to act as a deterrent, the child seeing punishments imposed on the parents as a result of his or her actions may reinvigorate the deterrent effect. In addition, this allows an extra tool in the teacher’s arsenal, and the mere thought of perhaps “triggering” a parental punishment may help bring some children into line."}
{"id": 2284, "content": "In most cases, in which the child is not subject to some sort of constitutional problem (genetic condition or otherwise), the disruptive behaviour of a child is a reflection of in adequate parental intervention over time. A normal child under normal circumstances should be expected to conform to behavioural expectations, and the failure to do so represents a partial inadequate job by the parents. The result is a cost that is transmitted to society. Children that are disruptive in school or in society via the criminal justice system cost the system extra money either in school resources and time or judicial-police resources as well as in the more obvious costs such as fixing vandalism and graffiti."}
{"id": 2285, "content": "The philosophy underling the proposition is one in which the child is not solely responsible for his or her own behaviour. Even if the threats of parental punishment and involvement are successful in the short term in modifying a child’s behaviour, the long term sequlae is that the child’s good behaviour is predicated not on an understanding of the consequence of their behaviour and a consideration of their own long term interests, but merely out of fear and external consequences. In the long run, instilling this message is likely to lead to future misbehaviour as the external punishments, in this case imposed on the parents, fall away. Once the child reaches an age at which the parents cannot be punished or the child does not care about parental punishment, building an ethic around such external consequences will fail to deter the child from misbehaviour."}
{"id": 2286, "content": "Many children that have consistent behavioural problems at school come from dysfunctional families in which either physical or emotional abuse and neglect is common. This has then resulted in behavior disorders such as Oppositional Defiant Disorder. Such actions by parental role models often lead to a vicious cycle in which the behaviour is then continued at school and in future generations. It is difficult to say what proportion of households may respond in this fashion, but if even a small proportion of children are actively harmed by this policy, it is a strong argument against its uniform adoption."}
{"id": 2287, "content": "A short argument, but a potentially powerful one. The assumption that children will not act out even more under such a regime in a bid to lash out at parents is untenable. Misbehaviour at school is often a rebellion against authority anyway, and the ultimate authority in most children’s lives is the parents. Therefore, as acting out against both of these institutions is consistent with the misbehaving mind set, it follows that tying school misbehaviour to parental detriments is unlikely to affect the child and may even serve to encourage their bad deeds."}

Madeline Ehrman observes that the root of this problem is that the “student is “out of sync” with the methodology, the teacher.”  Therefore, the antidote is more modern learning styles; “there are some quick fixes that can be made when adaptations are needed”. For example students struggle even with their own grammar so an emphasis on making themselves understood rather than correct grammar may be more useful."}

If students want to specialise in for example Science and drop foreign languages in order to be able to do this then they should have this option, a choice which is likely to be beneficial for their chosen career. Students’ progress in their most successful subjects should not be hindered by the burden of language learning. It is not the case that students do not desire to engage in languages because they are lazy, narrow-minded or blinkered. Rather, because they demonstrate real strength in other subjects they do not wish to be constrained in those subjects by ones where they do not excel. A standard complaint is quoted by Ehrman; “(learning languages) affects (all study) a lot! I’m finding it just depressing to have to study, when my only reason for being here is to meet a requirement…it really annoys me to have to waste my time on this, when I could be learning something I’ll use after graduation…The pressure’s just too much for me!” Students should be allowed and encouraged to channel all their energy and enthusiasm into the subjects they are best at and most enthusiastic towards."}
{"id": 2290, "content": "There are many people who will never excel in languages whether they are forced to learn it or not, and if they are not going to succeed then why waste all the time trying to make them succeed. With learning foreign languages there is a problem of anxiety in the classroom. This is particularly disabling as students must be able to speak up and be heard, usually by the whole class, in order to make progress. This anxiety is likely to be closer to panic than it would be in other subjects. This will be even more pronounced with dyslexic children. They struggle with the written word and so will necessarily do even worse when studying foreign languages. Yet they can excel in other subjects such as mathematics."}
{"id": 2291, "content": "There is a gulf between people who do make progress in languages and those who do not. Those able in languages struggle to deconstruct the difficult concepts and explain them to learners who cannot understand. Teachers cannot empathise with students who struggle. Expecting students who have great difficulty in learning languages to be able to do so from those who cannot even explain linguistic concepts successfully is far too much to ask. This one reason why in the UK Ofsted (Office for Standards in Education) considers language teaching in secondary schools to be weak. People who are bilingual due to their background do not think in grammar. If  they  do not know why certain grammatical constructions are used when and why, how is an absolute beginner struggling with languages supposed to understand such grammar rules?"}

In 2008 there were 569,080 students in independent schools in England,(BBC 2009)  - this would be a very large extra burden for state schools to bear. These students’ parents are therefore not only paying for their own children but also for students to study at state schools as well."}

Currently early-school leaving is linked with other indicators of socio-economic disadvantage, such as low-income jobs or high unemployment.

If they lack aptitude, ability or interest the extra time in the classroom is likely to benefit them very little, especially when they have not chosen to be there.

If they are excluded from school their disadvantage is extended over more years while if they are included, they damage the education of others in their class for even longer.

It is a myth that somehow parents lacks the capacity to deal with an issue like sex. Rather, they are the best suited to it. The fact is that children generally listen to their parents, or at least consider seriously what they are told by them.

Sexual experience is a gradual process and cannot be meaningfully taught in the structured environment of the classroom. People must discover much about their own sexuality, through experimentation and self-exploration. By trying to impose a strict curriculum that explains sexual processes and practices along set guidelines, much of the opportunity for self-discovery is lost. Furthermore, when people are forced to conform to the set sex education program, they cannot move at their own pace. This is particularly harmful to people who are physically or emotionally less mature than their fellow students and who would be better served if they were allowed to pursue sexual knowledge at their own pace. When other students are involved in the classroom, there is necessarily a degree of peer pressure, which places a further strain on the later bloomers of the class to conform and experiment sexually before they are ready. Teachers cannot cater their lessons to every single student, and thus students with less conventional sexual preferences and identities are left without meaningful engagement in the classroom."}

Sex education does not fall within its responsibility. Sexuality is for many people deeply personal and should be respected as such; young people should be allowed to explore their sexuality independently and with the guidance of family, not under the watching eye of the state. Inevitably teachers’ personal opinions on sexuality will bleed into their teaching, as will that of the state officials that set the teaching standards for the subject. In this way there is always a normative judgment in sex education that will be seen as the state mandating certain sexual behaviour and practice. This fundamentally attacks the rights of individuals to develop their mode of sexual expression independent of the nanny state’s instruction and can irrevocably harm peoples’ sexual identity."}

Setting homework extends study beyond school hours, allowing a wider and deeper education. It also makes the best use of teachers, who can spend lesson time teaching rather than just supervising individual work that could be done at home. Education is about pushing boundaries, and the learning should not stop at the entrance to the classroom – students should take skills learnt in the classroom and apply them at home. Homework allows this to happen, encouraging students to go above and beyond what they do in school. Reading is the best example, students learn how to read at school, but in order to get better, they need to practise and that is best done at home, with the support of parents and at the right pace for the student."}

According to the HACAN report the Department for Transport only accepts that noise is a problem if a community is subjected to over 57 decibels of noise over the course of a year according to a 1985 Government study. In which case only the boroughs of Richmond and Hounslow would be affected. However this does not tie in with Londoner’s experiences.

Although animals can’t tell us if they are in pain, the best metrics we have – brain activity, eye movement and making sounds – indicate that the animals are in pain during this period. When we have two methods of killing the animal available, it is inhumane to use the more painful one. It follows that we should require stunning."}

People with concerns about the way their food is produced would be distressed if they knew they were eating meat which had been inhumanely slaughtered. The fact that they don’t actually know is neither here nor there – we should bear in mind their ethical positions. Everyone is eating the meat, so everyone has a say.

Animals are trained to perform tricks using whips, electronic goads, sticks, food-deprivation etc. Wild animals such as lions, tigers, and elephants are kept in shamefully inadequate conditions in tiny spaces. The necessity of regular transportation means that the circus can never provide an appropriate home for wild animals. These animals are forced to travel thousands of miles in cramped and squalid conditions and frequently end up physically and mentally ill. And what for? Purely for the entertainment of we arrogant exploitative humans. What sort of lesson does it teach our children about non-human animals to take them to the circus and see these great creatures demeaned and controlled by force to perform silly tricks? Horses and dogs are among the principle victims of exploitation in human sporting activities. The main purpose of horse- and dog-racing is for human beings to indulge their penchant for gambling. The welfare of the animals involved is at best a secondary concern. Horses are frequently injured and die in horse races, especially races over hurdles such as the infamous British 'Grand National'; they are also blinkered and whipped to make them run faster, even the British Horseracing Authority has accepted the use of the whip needs to be limited out of concern for the welfare of the animals. It is unconvincing to claim that the animals can enjoy being subjected to this. As for the conditions the animals are kept in, these may be good for the top dogs and horses, but in the main conditions are poor, and once the animals cease to win races they are likely to be neglected, abandoned, or slaughtered.

The harm of a leak 300m underground is significantly limited, if the area has been chosen correctly then there should be no water sources nearby to contaminate. If this is the case, then a leak’s harm would be limited to the layers of sediment nearby which would be unaffected by radiation. By comparison a leak outside might lead to animals nearby suffering from contamination. Further nuclear waste might reach water sources should there be a leak above ground, if it is raining heavily when the leak happens for example. Further, the other options available, such as above ground storage present a potentially greater danger, should something go wrong. This is because it is much easier for nuclear waste to leak radiation into the air. This is problematic because even a hint of radiation may well cause people to panic owing to the damaging and heavily publicised consequences of previous nuclear safety crises. As such, underground storage is safer both directly and indirectly.1 As well as this, underground storage also prevents nuclear waste or nuclear radiation from reaching other states and as such, results in greater safety across borders.2 Further, storing all nuclear waste underground means that countries can concentrate their research and training efforts on responding to subterranean containment failures. Focus and specialisation of this type is much more likely to avert a serious release of nuclear material from an underground facility than the broad and general approach that will be fostered by diverse and distinct above-ground storage solutions."}

One example of this is the scrub mint, an endangered plant species which has been found to contain an anti-fungal agent and a natural insecticide, and thus holds great potential for use that benefits humans. One example of this is the Pacific yew (a tree species) which became the source of taxol, one of the most potent anticancer compounds ever discovered. This was the case with the (now banned) dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) pesticide, as the deterioration of the bald eagle and the peregrine falcon through their exposure to DDT in fact alerted humans to the potential health hazards of this pesticide, not just to animals but also to humans.

Thus with our greater power comes a greater responsibility to act in a moral fashion, and not simply to prioritize our own human good over that of other species. The ability of animal species, for example, to feel pain and suffering is something we should consider and try to avoid, as we recognise that pain is bad for ourselves, and thus must be bad for animals as well.

For example, there is a great modern-day interest in the dodo species of bird which was hunted to extinction in Mauritius in the 17th Century. Because we place a moral value on the ability of humans to make decisions (as we consider it to be a good thing when we ourselves have this ability) we should recognise that the possibly differing opinions of future generations should constrain our choices somewhat, and we should protect endangered species so that future generations can decide for themselves regarding their value."}

Ecologists and conservationists have in fact struggled to demonstrate the increased material benefits to humans of 'intact' wild systems over man-made ones such as farms and urban environments, which many species simply adapt to.

He is the figure head of the nation, the pinnacle of capitalism and masculinity, of which the penis and sex are instrumental in this image. By leaving the painting up, it encourages hyper-masculinity (which is inherently violent),  because it assumes there is an inherent link between power and the penis.

{"id": 2327, "content": "This bill that opens the door to creationism is really about changing the way that teaching is done to make it more critical and analytical. This is an improvement in scientific education as it will help ensure that science is about critical, constructive discourse rather than just imbibing ‘facts’. That would not be education, it would be indoctrination."}
{"id": 2328, "content": "What this bill allows is for the facts to be taught and then seen through the lens of various theories. The bill requires that the schools within the state remain within the state science curriculum. It “protects the teaching of scientific information, and shall not be construed to promote any religious or non-religious doctrine”. The result therefore is that this Tennessee law opens up academic enquiry and science rather than shutting it down as opponents claim."}
{"id": 2329, "content": "There is a difference between a demand for freedom to teach what you like and freedom of speech. Freedom of speech does not apply in the classroom; students are not allowed to stand up and discuss whatever issues they want and neither should the teacher. Both have to stick to a syllabus that ensures that the children are taught the basics of each subject so that the student can move on to more advanced instruction. Ultimately for students to be able to exercise their right to freedom of speech they need to have a well-rounded education that provides a grounding of knowledge and how to analyse that knowledge. The student is then perfectly free to challenge this teaching and exercise their freedom of expression and explore many more ideas and dismiss evolution if they wish. Essentially this bill is encouraging criticism of science at too early a stage, in elementary or even secondary school teachers are still teaching what science is, what it is for and how it works and it does not help to ‘muddy the waters’."}
{"id": 2330, "content": "Part of freedom of speech is the freedom to get accurate information. The students in school have this right not to be misled by their teachers  so teachers should have to concentrate on providing facts and evidence and what has been scientifically proven. Eugenie C. Scott of the National Center for Science Education argues “Telling students that evolution and climate change are scientifically controversial is miseducating them” because there is no controversy among scientists. This would be directly counter to the objective teaching the bill claims to promote. If there is to be objectivity schools must stick to the evidence and what it shows; evolution. The teachers may of course encourage the students to come up with their own interpretations of the evidence but should not be attempting to force their own views upon the students."}
{"id": 2331, "content": "History is not about learning all history, it is not about learning particular bits of history, it is not even necessarily about learning a nations’ story, rather it is about encouraging students to think critically. It has been regularly shown that stuffing children with facts turns them off a subject instead there should be interaction, discussion, analysing texts from the time and analysing bias. What matters therefore is how the teachers teach the issues as they will have to supplement the textbooks with other works and there is a wide range to choose from."}
{"id": 2332, "content": "To some the idea of a national story may be an anachronism but history is one of the things that bind a country together. As Benedict Anderson argues nations are ‘imagined communities’ as members of that nation will never know most of the members of that community or even hear about them but despite this there is conceived to be a comradeship between its members. French historian Ernest Renan went so far as to argue that ‘Getting its history wrong is part of being a nation’."}
{"id": 2333, "content": "While the state may like to whitewash history to produce its own ‘national history’ that sticks to one grand narrative that is about the state this is not history as it really is. While a national history full of patriotism may be good for instilling a love of the nation it is not much use at teaching anything else. In particular it is damaging to any attempt to teach analysis and the use of sources through history. History is for the most part not useful in and of itself,  there are for example very few jobs directly working with history. Rather teaching of history emphasises ‘transferrable skills’ such as Critical Analysis, Reasoning and Argument  all of which are suppressed if focused on one officially approved narrative. Moreover having the darker side of a nation’s past both makes history more interesting and more believable and so making it more likely that those being taught it will relate to it. Making the past look whiter than white simply makes it seem out of touch with reality. It makes for a poor teacher as history needs to ‘teach by example’ and if that example is not a complex character that can be related to it has little relation to every day experience."}
{"id": 2334, "content": "Few nations go so far as to deify their national heroes or the formation of the state but none the less it is disrespectful to attack these ideas and many people are likely to be offended. This is indeed the case with the film Mustafa about Atatürk one doctor referring to the poster advertising the film asks \"Why is he shown like that, in front of a steppe? His head is down as if he is apologizing for something... I find it disrespectful\". Professors Orhan Kural and Ahmet Ercan argue “The content of the film and its interpretation of its topics damage the republic and Atatürk. Damaging such values can lead to the breakup of Turkey and to the loss of national pride.”  This is because any attack on Atatürk is equally an attack on the values of the republic he created, some of which such as secularism are already under attack. It is both wrong to offend so many people and unwise, as is the case with the attack on Atatürk, to attack the foundations of the ideology that helps to prevent intolerance."}
{"id": 2335, "content": "Past leaders are dead and if they have become heroes it has already been accepted that accounts of that figure may not be entirely accurate as with any myths and legends – and indeed many country’s heroes are myths such as King Arthur. Where they are not as in the case of Atatürk the man is mythologised in order to help show the unity of the nation and provide an example, an ideal if you will, for those who follow. Insulting this hero by deliberately publicising their dark side is therefore damaging not just for the state but for those who believe in the in the role model that the hero provides. In a country like Turkey where the focus of history teaching is on political citizenship education based upon national history everyone in Turkey learns about Atatürk. The aim is to educate pupils “As future citizens who respect the principles and reforms of Atatürk and democracy; who care for their families, country and the nation; who are aware of their responsibilities towards the Republic of Turkey; who work for promoting their families, country and the nation.”  So any attack will be damaging one of the role models for Turks young and old."}

The name and chorus of the song performed was Virgin Mary, Chase Putin Out. Where any punishment required for this act – and Proposition contends that there was not – then it was at most a mild public order offence. Amnesty International and the overwhelming majority of the International media have reached that conclusion. The very fact that this has become a  cause celebre  shows the extent to which those who able to step back from the situation recognise this for what it is; a clear abuse of presidential power given the thinnest sheen of respectability by a compliant church. Such religious content as was contained in the protest fairly obviously relates to the setting and is not the main content of the song. It’s a fairly straightforward artistic device. It does, however, raise the question that if the intent of this song was to be blasphemous – a necessary component of proving it to be so – then why did they do such a bad job of it and spend so much their time going on about politics; it would suggest somewhat incompetent activists."}

There is an entirely understandable interest in the publication of the book in a country where it is so notorious. It’s important to bear in mind that this is not a bomb making manual and most experts feel that the arguments are weak to the point of absurdity  – and the commentary will serve to enforce that point. The content of the book, in and of itself, were not therefore grounds for continued suppression of the text. Generally speaking, it seems a relatively sensible rule of thumb that if there is no direct harm that can be shown as a result of publication and there is sufficient interest to merit doing so then it would normally be published . By doing so ahead of the end of the copyright, the state will prevent commercial publishers making a profit and this should dampen down the impact of its arrival. It is standard to take such a presumption in favour of publication in many other circumstances, even where some groups may find doing so offensive – the Satanic Verses being a case in point. It seems sensible to treat Mein Kampf as just another book.

This becomes an issue of free speech when by compelling people to acquire information in a certain way means that they either have less access to that information or less chance of effectively digesting it. For those for whom are proficient Braille is their preferred medium, , it is their only medium for text, and is useful for using computers which may use a braille display. A majority of people receive their news online but newspapers still exist because some people prefer them.

Whatever the reasons for its enduring success, it remains one of the great design achievements of humanity as a species, comfortably alongside the wheel, the screw and cash. Whatever the reason for this enduring success, it has it and the latest set of doomsayers may well go the way of the rest. Perhaps the greatest reason for its enduring success is that the book is silent. The reader gives voice to characters and charts their own way through fiction or selects their own phrases for emphasis in non-fiction. There is nobody – actor or director – between the reader and the author. If that applies to the printed word it applies equally or more to Braille.

For those who find it impossible – such as deaf and blind students – clearly other alternatives need to be provided but it seems sensible to look to the technologies of the future to fulfil those needs rather than those of the past."}
{"id": 2341, "content": "To argue that this is a matter of the infringement of the right to free speech is not only wrong but offensive to those who have had that right genuinely curtailed. A stifling of free speech is about cutting off people’s access to ideas, denying them the right to take those ideas and present them to others. The slow, natural death of Braille does not do that. Fewer than one in ten blind children now learn Braille . Those who wish to continue to use Braille can do so just as those who prefer to write a letter rather than send an email can do so. Both groups however, accept that it is likely to become more expensive and exclude them from the rest of society as others adapt and new technologies become the norm. The information and ideas are there, they are available in a format that is available, even if it is not the format of absolute preference.

It is in the nature of religious belief that any set of views can adopt a religious justification and there is no objective measure against which to hold the views. For example the homophobic views which have common currency in many churches can be contrasted with a gay liberation trend discernible in others. In the light of this, it makes sense to judge the views on their own basis, regardless of the religiosity surrounding them. The views expressed by Harry Hammond, and others , need to be stripped of their religious veneer and shown that at their heart they are simply offensive. There is absolutely no reason why LGBT people should have to endure vitriol and condemnation as they go about their daily lives. It is a useful exercise to consider how we would respond to a secular speaker saying that the actions of two people who were in love with each other should condemn them to torment and suffering.

Voltaire’s comment that “I may not agree with what you say but I will defend to the death your right to say it” is a statement of the very same principle that that demands equality for all groups in society. In exactly the same way that all views are, at the very least, worthy of a hearing, so are all lifestyles acceptable. Locking people up in the name of liberty makes no sense at all. Equally, banning statements on the basis that it might be offensive to some people has been used as an excuse to prevent social and cultural developments, the process of being offended usually made society and culture stronger for it. We tend to fear or hate that which is hidden or unspoken. The emancipation and liberation of other groups has tended to suggest that open debate is a more productive answer than trying to ban opinions and views."}

Governments that attempt to lead, ahead of public opinion, on matters such as this do little to resolve the problem. In doing so in this manner, they may well pour fuel on the fire of the very prejudice they are aiming to combat as well as creating additional problems by justifying the idea that it is okay to silence views simply because you happen to disagree with them. Banning the expression of ideas has, historically, be the recourse of those who have run out of arguments to defeat them; doing so is an acknowledgement that the proposal is a weak one.

The only way to avoid newspapers being constantly full of replies to irrelevant data would be to give a far broader right of reply to the opinions presented or the conclusions draw – the actions where journalism really has its power. Many newspapers already do this out of professional courteousy and respect for the truth, for example the guardian has a ‘Response’ column in its Comment is free section. The idea of a right of reply is fine in theory but, in reality, it is difficult to see how it would have any real impact on the day to day working of the press.

Different countries tackle press regulation in different ways. In some the threat to freedom of speech comes from over-regulation, in others from an over-mighty press drowning out dissent.

The reality is that large numbers of people in many countries and religious traditions find blasphemy offensive and upsetting.

We place limitations on violence, sex and expletives in movies, on TVs and in publications, not because they cause a provable harm but because some find them offensive . These actions, along with blasphemy, are collectively classed as criminal libels as they require the state to act rather than an injured party. We further create public order offences in relation to racial abuse, which, like blasphemy, may not be premeditated . Those in breach of such limits face a punishment. If we are happy to impose widely held norms of behaviour in public fora such as entertainment – or in regard to public behaviour - then why not acknowledge similar issues in the case of spiritual beliefs.

Banning the practice would make it easier to encourage healthier diets and lifestyles. Selling alcohol below cost price leads to large social harms caused by alcoholism and binge-drinking. The use of alcohol as a loss leader has already been identified as a problem in some countries. In New Zealand, for example, Foodstuffs and Progressive Enterprises—the two companies that own all of the major supermarket chains in the country—agreed not to use alcohol as a loss leader.1 Of course companies in most countries would not agree to such a promise without being prohibited by law, and even New Zealand should go a step further by prohibiting all loss leaders, as alcohol is not the only good that can cause social harm when it is artificially inexpensive."}

In this way, loss leaders are a con trick on consumers who are bewildered by deliberately confusing marketing–an onslaught of advertising and ever-changing promotions to the point that they are unable to compare the prices of rival firms and make a rational choice about where to shop. In their paper, “Loss Leading as an Exploitative Practice,” Zhijun Chen and Patrick Rey show how retailers use loss leaders to trick consumers by giving them incomplete information.1 And in the long term, by driving out smaller retailers and reducing competition in the retail sector, the practice can drive up the overall cost of essentials for everyone."}

Visit any open-air market at 3.00 p.m. and you will see traders slashing the prices of unsold perishable goods for just this reason. If a retailer is going to sell an item below price level, it might as well use that item as a marketing device.

Even if this succeeds, it is still very difficult to define what a 'good performance' is, because a student's individual performance is determined by many other factors than the teacher and also because an individual student's 'performance' is actually a complex set of attitudes, skills and abilities which are in and of themselves hard to operationalize in a standard test. And even if this succeeds, then the questions is how much of a student's performance is attributable to what specific teacher: oftentimes, at least in high school, students will have many different teachers, making it impossible to gauge what teacher was responsible for what test result. Finally, it should be noted (per the argument included above) that merit based education does not encourage the dissemination and normalisation of best practice. A merit-based pay scheme is likely to collapse when too many of those who work under it meet its criteria for bonus payments, making it too expensive. Once merit based pay becomes part of the structure of an institution, it will become hard to attract and retain staff if it is removed. Concurrently, performance at the same level will be expected by the public, although an institution may not be able to afford it. For the reasons stated above, good ideas are unlikely to be shared by teaching staff under a merit-based status quo, for fear that they may be giving away a competitive edge over their colleagues. It might be better to raise standards in education by investing sustainably in improved training for teachers and improved facilities in schools, rather than creating an unsustainable merit-based reward system."}
{"id": 2370, "content": "A mandatory retirement age creates increased opportunities for younger workers, especially in higher ranking jobs. There is no need to apply a universal retirement age will across every sector of the economy. Different retirement ages can reflect the differing demands of particular jobs. The job performance of fighter pilots or surgeons may suffer as a result of the creeping debility uniformly associated with aging – a process known as senescence. Individuals in these occupations are usually compelled to retire earlier than the general population. However, there is one factor that justifies both collective adjustment of existing mandatory retirement ages, and the imposition of mandatory retirement ages on jobs that do not become significantly harder or riskier as workers age. The absence of mandatory retirement may create gerontocracies – businesses that promote employees according to their seniority. The leadership of gerontocratic businesses and organisations are usually dominated by older individuals . Where retirement ages are high, or a culture of absolute deference to seniority is entrenched- as in Japan- a gerontocracy can emerge. An aging class of executives and directors can engage in patrimonial practices that ensure only other, older workers are able to access senior management positions. This has the effect of suppressing pay rates among younger employees and discouraging innovation and independent thought . After all, why would a young employee engage in the extra labour and learning necessary to solve intractable problems or develop new products if they will gain no recognition for their efforts? Requiring skilled or semi-skilled workers to retire at a particular age will also assist in reducing unemployment figures among the young. Retirees will vacate jobs for individuals who are approaching an age where financial independence and building a family become significant life-objectives. This approach is also economically efficient – it makes more sense for the state to pay out on a larger number of pensions- supported by private pension schemes- than to support the young unemployed. If young adults miss opportunities to build careers for themselves, or to become established in a particular trade, the costs associated with joining the labour force begin to rise. Skill sets decay or become outmoded; lack of personal funds reduces workers’ mobility. Thus, it can prove costly for the state to facilitate entry into the labour market for the chronically unemployed. The resolution is necessary for the long-term health of the workforce as a whole."}

Unions in this instance are problematic because whilst other groups do not have access to special privileges, unions are able to exert a significant and disproportionate amount of influence over the political process through the use of collective bargaining mechanisms. This argument applies to private unions as well, although to a lesser extent, and the banning of collective bargaining for private unions would be principally sound. In the case of unions in the private sector they can cause large amounts of disruption which has a large knock on impact on the economy giving leverage over politicians for whom the economy and jobs are always important issues. For example unions in transport in the private sector are just as disruptive as in the public sector. Even more minor businesses can be significant due to being in supply or logistics chains that are vital for important parts of the economy. Further, even if collective bargaining were to be considered a “right,” the government can curtail the rights of individuals and groups of people should it feel the harm to all of society is great enough. We see this with the limits that we put on free speech such that we may prevent the incitement of racial hatred."}

{"id": 2374, "content": "Collective bargaining is needed by people in any job. Within any firm there exist feedback structures that enable workers to communicate with managers and executive decision makers. However, there are some issues which affect workers significantly, but run against the principles of profit, or in this case the overall public good that the state seeks to serve. In this situation, a collection of workers are required. This is primarily because if suggested changes go against public interest then a single worker requesting such a change is likely to be rejected. However, it is the indirect benefit to public interest through a workforce that is treated better that must also be considered. But indirect benefit can only truly occur if there are a large number of workers where said indirect benefit can accrue. Specifically, indirect benefit includes the happiness of the workforce and thus the creation of a harder working workforce, as well as the prevention of brain drain of the workforce to other professions. When a single person is unhappy for example, the effect is minimal, however if this effect can be proved for a large number of people then an adjustment must be made. In order for these ideas to be expressed, workers can either engage in a collective bargaining process with their employer, or take more drastic action such as strikes or protests to raise awareness of the problem. Given that the alternate option is vastly more disruptive, it seems prudent to allow people to do collectively bargain."}

As such, the monopolist in this area has the power to set wages without losing a significant number of employees.

If the state allows freedom of association, individuals will gather together and exchange their ideas and views as a natural consequence of this freedom. Further, free association and free expression allows groups to then select a representative to express their ideas in a way that the individuals in the group might not be able to. In preventing people from using this part of their right to assembly, we weaken the entire concept of the right to assembly. The point of the right to assembly is to allow the best possible representation for individuals. When a group of individuals are prevented from enjoying this right then it leads to those individuals feeling isolated from the rest of society who are able to enjoy this right. This is particularly problematic in the case of public sector workers as the state that is isolating them also happens to be their employer. This hurts the way that people in the public sector view the state that ideally is meant to represent them above all as they actively contribute to the well being of the state."}

Companies should be looking for those who are best qualified for the job rather than satisfying a government quota to provide temporary contracts to young people. Even if the government is paying for this employee they are still utilising the resources of businesses. Businesses will often have limited space so having some of that space taken up by mandated temporary workers is not the most productive use that the company could be making of that space. It is clear that this would be a ‘make work’ scheme because there are already only around two million vacancies, compared to five and a half million unemployed under 25s, in the entire European Union .

If the company is not looking to expand there will be little point in wasting resources on someone they are not going to take on over the long term. Training has to be the solution to youth unemployment. The government should be training young people to fill the gaps that do exist in the market place such as care workers.

This then provides a minimum standard and aid should only be given to those that ensure those minimum standards they have signed up. It would also help compliance to prioritise those who go further in their protections of labour when it comes to receiving aid.

This helps in achieving the goals of a stable long term plan for economic growth as well paid workers are necessary for consumer spending. Employing higher standards would be a way to tackle the problems with distribution of aid at the grassroots and increase efficiency within the system organically. It is essential to raise these standards to an international level, implementing standards against practices like child labour. If this is done then the purpose of development aid, which is to increase the day to day standard of living of the people, will improve.

{"id": 2389, "content": "Businesses operating in a free market are concerned principally with their bottom lines. In order to increase profits, firms will seek to exploit workers, to lower wages as far as possible. This exploitation will continue indefinitely, unless the state intervenes. The state does so by implementing a minimum wage. The lowest paid workers tend to be less educated, less skilled, and less organized than higher-paid employees. This makes them the easiest to manipulate and the easiest to replace. Certainly, it is far better for state, which has citizens’ best interest at heart, to weigh in on the issue of setting wages than businesses, which tend not to care about their workers’ welfare or have competing interests. Furthermore, a minimum wage sends a social signal of valuation; it affirms that all people have worth, cannot be exploited, and are owed by dint of their humanity a certain level of treatment in the workforce, i.e. This is important as a means to assist the self-empowerment of the poorest members of society, by encouraging them to value themselves. Also, the minimum wage aids in promoting social justice and equality by lowering wage disparities. This form of social justice is certainly preferable to the class divisions propagated in the absence of a minimum wage, in which a part of society is relegated to permanent wage slavery."}
{"id": 2390, "content": "Without a minimum wage, the lowest paid members of society are relegated to effective serfdom, and their decisions of these members often force others to follow suit, accepting similarly low wages. There is no real freedom of choice for people at this lowest level of the social structure, since they must accept whatever wage is offered in order to feed themselves and their families. Their poverty and desperation for work makes it much more difficult for them to act collectively to bargain for better wages. The minimum wage frees people from this bondage and guarantees them resources with which to make meaningful choices. Because people’s choices are intrinsically interconnected, and wages tend to reflect the prevailing pressures of demand and supply, when an individual makes the choice to work for less than anyone else, he necessarily lowers the wage that others can ask, leading to a downward spiral of wages as workers undercut one another, each competing to prove he is worth the least. A minimum wage ensures workers do not harm each other through self-destructive wage competition. People want to be happy, and find that only way to obtain the resources necessary to attain comfort and security is through employment. Fundamentally, the minimum wage grants the freedom not to be exploited, giving individuals the freedom to control their own destinies."}

This demand-induced economic growth is a very important part of economic growth. The more people are able to spend, the more money flows into the economy, leading to more business and higher employment. Without the minimum wage, a downward spiral of spending can ensue, proving deleterious to firms and the economy generally.

At the most basic level, people should have their right to choice maximized, not circumscribed by arbitrary government impositions.

By exposing emerging economies and authoritarian states to developed world standards of transparency, meritocracy and corporate social responsibility, they will help to spread liberal values and raise standards. They will also give many more nations a stake in international prosperity through trade, encouraging cooperation rather than confrontation in foreign policy, and giving a boost to liberalising trade deals at the WTO.

It is also more harmonious, since well-funded services keep people from feeling desperate and to turn to such things as crime. But greater equality itself can also be beneficial, as it reduces distinctions between groups in society, and prevents stratification into social classes based on wealth.

So, for example, one of the reasons for lower pricing in some products in particular countries is that they do not include all of the same ingredients as a product sold under the same brand name in another country. This can be, for example, because the performance needs (e.g. the climate), regulatory framework, or consumers' willingness to pay in the two countries vary.

Thus, individuals vary greatly in the degree in which they espouse, if at all, values by a single cultural group, such as their national culture” . As a result, people can identify with several different cultures often at one time. This creates difficulties in allowing one person to seek compensation from another purely on the basis of identity politics – individuals at least partially define their own culture and it may only be one among multiple cultures they identify with. Culture itself has a complex nature; it adapts, borrows and evolves. It also influences lives in different ways and to different extents. No culture is fully homogenous. Because of this, any model for the extent of compensation would almost be impossible. Somebody with a long distant relative of which they haven't met, could potentially gain compensation for something that doesn’t directly affect them. They may even identify with the majority culture that is doing the compensating.

According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, global warming from human-produced greenhouse gases is a primary cause of the \"unprecedented\" retreat of glaciers around the world since the early 20th century. Since 1980 glaciers worldwide have lost nearly 40 feet (12 meters) in average thickness. According to a 2013 IPCC report, \"glaciers have continued to shrink almost worldwide\" over the prior two decades, and there is \"high confidence\" (about an 8 out of 10 chance) that Northern Hemisphere spring snow continues to decrease. If the glaciers forming the Greenland ice sheet were to melt entirely, global sea levels could increase by up to 20 feet. Melting glaciers also change the climate of the surrounding region. With the loss of summer glacial melt water, the temperatures in rivers and lakes increase. According to the US Geological Service, this disruption can include the \"extinction of temperature sensitive aquatic species.\""}

It can be said that if women were allowed on the front line then perhaps they would distract the men. Men may be more prone to look out for their female colleagues perhaps at the expense of their own life or others around them. There is also an issue of emotions clouding their judgement. If soldiers on the front line were mixed then it would be inevitable that relationships would be formed. This could lead to problems as soldiers will become more focused on the safety of their partner than on the job in hand. On the other hand, if a relationship ended badly, it would clearly affect their working lives. Another problem that was brought to my attention was the issue of hostages. Although women can be just as mentally strong etc as their male counterparts, there is a difference. Women, unfortunately, could be subjected to rape as well as torture while in the custody of our enemies. This leaves them with much more than physical scars which may never heal properly. Perhaps women should not be on the front line as men are perceived to be better at coping with the aftermath of torture and death. Everyone feels the pain when they lose one of their friends. The servicemen and women all live, eat, sleep, work together, creating a very strong bond between them. Men, however, might be able to cope better when faced with the loss of one of them than a woman. Women are stereotypically more sensitive and may struggle to separate themselves enough to ensure that no more losses are caused. Women should not be allowed on the front line as I believe that men would go out of their way to 'protect' their female colleagues which could endanger not only themselves and those around them, but it could jeoporadise their mission. Also, I do not believe that women can cope as easily as men when faced with torture and death.

But that is not to say that greater punishment is the answer either. There must be a balance between ensuring the safety of the general public and also the welfare of those sufferring from such a genetically inherent violent streak. For some, taking a step inside the minds of killers in an attempt to empathise with them is a step too far, but to not allow consideration of 'why' someone has committed a crime is perhaps a step in the wrong direction."}

Before such a defence gains judicial validity in future court cases courts must be certain that such a predisposition actually exists and has the effects to the extent to which it is claimed. Giuseppe Novelli, a forensic scientist and geneticist at the University Tor Vergata in Rome says, \"We don't know how the whole genome functions and the protective effects of other genes\". If such a defence is to be allowed in law then there must be a better understanding and scientifically proven basis for its use before it is employed in any court, particularly where a crime of murder is concerned."}

In the past courts have seen fit to rule against people who suffer from diabetes and who, having failed to properly control their condition or by not taking their medication, have caused injury or worse whilst falling asleep at the wheel of their vehicles. Knowing your condition better than anyone else are you not therefore more responsible for your behaviour? The role of the Law is to draw boundries and set a precedent for what is acceptable behaviour and what is permissable in society. So what precedent has this ruling set? At a glance it would appear to indicate that courts will adopt a more lenient approach with those members of society who are more likely to commit crimes such as murder. Predisposed to violence or not, we are all aware of the law, if not its intricate details then at the very least the difference between right and wrong. Being more prone to violent outbursts must demand that those who suffer from this gene take greater precaution to control their behaviour as opposed to being granted leniency from the courts."}

Do you want to walk into a bus filled with so many people you have to stand? Not to mention alot of people walk to places using less gas, and if everyone uses bus's that will make the weight of the bus heavier resulting in using more gas. Not to mention if its free the idea of puplic transport will be more popular so the companies will have to make much more (Bus's, Subways,e.t.c). Making much more Bus's will cost alot of many.

{"id": 2709, "content": "Colossal time and money is being invested into research centred around the advantages GM food could impose on our health. It is clear that those developing GM foods attribute exceptionally high value to them, as scientists have been so bold as to suggest their function in repelling cancer (5). Some might argue that such resources could be better spent focusing on cures for diseases themselves, but by experimenting in this area, scientists are proposing to us another dimension in which we can fight for better health. If all goes to plan and GM food is proven to be safe, much strain could be removed from the NHS. People might prefer to eat fruit containing vaccines rather than to undergo injections and may build up their immune systems and reduce their reliance on the health services. As a result this could impact hugely in society in general; if numbers requiring healthcare were small enough, the government could dedicate more of its budget to other worthwhile causes."}
{"id": 2710, "content": "Pressure groups such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth are among those who oppose GM foods: environmentalists. They object to herbicide-resistant crops, which would allow farmers to spray herbicide, killing the weeds yet not affecting the crop, and to use a smaller amount of herbicide which are expensive. However, such opposition groups would be concerned at its impact on the environment. Despite society’s modern commitment to the interests of the environment, it seems difficult to argue that its safety should be prioritised over health. The majority of us wouldn’t notice the harmful effect of herbicide, but we would certainly be aware of the estimated strength of our immune systems if we were to consume certain GM foods, once approved, which would develop our health."}
{"id": 2711, "content": "Through the process of GM, plants can be made to resist weed killers and be insect resistant. Because GM crops can be made to be resistant to weed killers, farmers can easily spray their whole fields with weed killers. They effectively kill off unwanted weeds, while their GM crops remain unharmed. Because farmers wouldn’t have to till as much to get the weeds out if they used GM friendly weed killer, it would have resultant environmental benefits. Because GM crops can be designed so that they are largely insect resistant, the crops can virtually be free of such insects. Opponents argue against this because they say that many kinds of animals will be wiped out in a domino effect if insects become extinct from the food chain as a result of insect resistant GM crops. They say GM crops that are resistant to herbicides will morph into hybrids(super weeds) which will not be able to be killed or controlled. Influencing the food chain is always a risk. This risk is associated with all types of farming. For example, an organic farmer who hoes his field would be equally effective at destroying potential feed and habitats for birds. Not all insects die from GM plants because not all insects feed on GM plants. Weeds that are resistant to one herbicide such as glyphosphate can be killed by another herbicide such as glufosinate."}
{"id": 2712, "content": "Many of the supposed benefits of GM food are extracted from natural ingredients; why not just eat them? The cancer-defying tomato contains the same pigments found in blueberries, blackberries and cranberries, which are all healthy foods we could eat and gain the same nutrition value, without the risk of unpredictable side effects. Similarly, the soya bean created to protect against cardiovascular disease and diabetes takes omega3 acids which are found in oily fish to do so. Again, people could stick to eating oily fish, or taking vitamin supplements containing omega3. Both options will increase a person’s health without any inherent risks. If people put a bit more time into considering the value of the food they eat, and did regular exercise, we wouldn’t always be on the lookout for some artificial means to restore us to health. It seems that scientists today welcome any excuse for experimenting with revolutionary technology. Arguably, there is only a perceived need for GM foods, not an actual one."}

A person with the right attitude will always be successful in their chosen career path. In terms of section 15 - AA was implemented to redress the inequalities of the past, with specific reference to workplace demographics. How long will the past be allowed to determine current and future employment and career practices ? What is the long term goal of the country in terms of skill upliftment and development opportunities - race or abilities ? The generally accepted principle that AA is a temporary measure is questioned as after the 15 years, this should have been already attained. Available skills and qualifications should already be in place and no longer a point of focus when employing new talent into the workplace. Also, the gravy train applies as much to the defined blacks in terms of this act, as it did to the whites in the apartheid era. How many of our black qualified graduates have left the country for better opportunities overseas? Think CA and nursing staff, as two examples. All women, in terms of the EE Act, are classified as PDI. Yet when it comes to BBEEE and DTI Codes, there is no accounting for white women in any definition.

The New Economics Foundation contends that these construction overruns and decommissioning costs are ‘hidden costs’ that are not included in the official statistics meaning that Nuclear is actually much more expensive than is claimed. According to British Energy and British Nuclear Fuels, the cost of nuclear generation is between 2.2 and 3.0p/kWh. But the NEF says that this figure is probably a severe underestimate, with the real cost being somewhere between 3.4 and 8.3/kWh.

For some reason, academic achievement is considered more important that engaging in a career that you want, or that you are exceptionally well-suited to.

What is the ultimate outcome of a perfect education? University professors; not valuable services.

This is not acceptable though because it can really hurt children. Also teachers who shout grades out loud are bullies. If a teacher tells a student’s grade out loud with intent to embarrass them, then they are bullying the student. It is not fair and can lead to a cycle of people bullying one another."}

Bullies pick on kids who stand out, either by being very good at something or very bad, either way victims tend to be loners. Victims tend not to fit in. In sum, bullies pick on kids with preexisting problems. Often times bullies were bullied in the past or fit the same criteria. A bully could be a teacher's pet or a jock just as a victim can be either. The question of the source of damage can be impossible to solve. Only about one eighth of all abuse victims become abusers themselves but almost every abuser was a victim. Bullies and victims(the demarcation between the two is not exactly defined) should be counseled to arrive at the root of the problem. Since both victims and bullies tend to already be damaged or at least odd, the question of how much of damage can be attributed directly to a bully is unanswerable."}

Hypersensitive kids could have tantrums over being told to shut up, whereas kids who are trying to always keep it together won't even squeal about a rape(and possibly commit suicide two decades later or lose his/her head or the possibilities are endless).

Bullies don't always pick on the loner: being vulnerable, shy, being well-liked, easy going, attractive, fair (something the bully lacks - fairness and honesty). Having a quality the bully wants but feels lacking in is a major incentive to someone who is inclined to bully. Bullies want power and control. Making someone else feel bad makes them feel better but it is short lived so they need to do it again and again. Girls especially bully other girls whom they are jealous of. In order to change the behaviour they need to learn emphathic skills which expulsion does not do and they need to be held accountable. Bullying is a serious issue that does cause major physical and emotional damage. The bullies in school today become future bullies in offices and in their families tomorrow."}

If you are vague and ambiguous when giving orders, strict about a matter one day but relaxed on the same matter a different day, the child will be confused and not know how to react, it will stress them out more to never be sure what is and is not OK than it is to be punished strictly a couple of times but to know exactly why. Children need to have ground rules so that they can comply with them throughout their life. If they are unaware of deviant behaviour and they continue that behaviour due to lack of rules being enforced then they would be continuing with the negative behaviour which is not acceptable. This is intended to show that disrespecting parents is offensive and was something you shouldn't do - a behaviour that makes you seem like a piece of garbage.

If you act as though they will be traumatised by feeling like a failure or being treated as such, the child will also think this way about themselves and never try and aim high. If everyone around them treats them as though they are emotionally fragile, they will assume this is how they are supposed to be and act neurotically. If you expect them to succeed at the highest level, they will assume this is the level that they are supposed to be working at and so will aim that high and eventually succeed."}

I also could not (and still can't to this day) function in day-to-day life if deprived of computer games. This was attempted for several months and all it achieved was to do me lasting psychological damage and make me more fragile and hence more dependent on my computer. To the writer of the article, using a computer game was seen as a useless activity for a child but for me it was not, it was a necessary activity. Parents aren't magically completely empathic with their child, they often make mistakes.

However, it is true that children are in turn responsible towards their parents and should be grateful to their parents for all they have done for the sake of the child, it does not mean that the children would feel bound to abide by their parents rigid rules at all times. A child is a separate human being with different emotions and different states of mind and parents should consider that.

If parents constantly set rules and boundaries for their child, there is going to come a time when the kid has had enough. They will begin to break the rules, and feel powerful doing it. Teens especially, do not adhere to rules and consequences. They are at the age of discovering their identities, finding independence, hormonal changes and peer pressure, all of which lead to acting out against mom and dad.

I think that any other time during school hours is not ok, because if a person is talking and you are sitting in your seat with your iPod, then you might get it taken away, but it is also being disrespectful to the person that is talking, because you are not giving them your attention and being a respectful listener. you can download games and apps prior to going to school and use them while connected to school wifi or not"}

They are not harming anyone by mere possession, and putting them in jail at huge cost to the taxpayer ruins their life and costs us all. Sending someone to jail for drug posession is a waste of money as well as being unjust. We allow people to drink alcohol (a drug) and smoke nicotine (a drug) but we criminalize people who take some less harmful drugs. This inconsistenty is part of the injustice of criminalizing people for posession of certain drugs. No one disputes the harm done by drugs, the question is how to treat the problem. Decades of rising drug use and drug related crime demonstrate that prohibition doesn't work. The vast majority of drug users do not committ other crimes to pay for their drugs. The real crime is the mugging, not the activity they are trying to pay for. People steal to buy all kinds of things, but it is the theft that should be the crime. Many drug addicts committ crime to feed their habit, but not every drug user is a drug addict. Millions of people take illegal drugs including many lawyers, teachers, doctors etc. They lead productive lives, why should the threat of jail hang over them because the government disagrees with their choice of drug? Prison does ruin someone's life, and it certainly does nothing to cure addiction. It makes it more likely that people will be dependent on drugs for the forseeable future as they have hardly any chance of getting a decent job with a criminal record. The public are not protected. Drugs are everywhere, dangerous drug dealers are common, drug related crime soars and so does drug addiction. Would anyone think that the solution to our alcohol problem is to jail anyone who has a drink? No most people think that rehab is the answer for alcoholics and that moderate drinkers should be largely left alone until they break some other law. So why do people think that for other drugs, some less dangerous than alcohol, the answer is criminal penalities? Even when the idea of treating drug addiction as a criminal problem has been tested to destruction and shown to be a complete failure. Keeping slaves violates the rights of others to live their life as they choose, its nothing like taking a drug. It is the prohibition on drugs that violates the rights of others, not the drug taking itself. Drinking alcohol isn't morally superior to taking illegal drugs just because the government has a hypocritical, inconsistent policy on drugs."}

The time has come for an effective and pragmatic drug policy. Prohibiton causes crime syndicates to flourish. If legalisation was to occur, crime groups would have one of their major sources of income cut off, thus lessening their negative impact on society.

There is plenty of information out there to allow people to make an informed choice.

As a professional employee we tend to forget that when we are employed we not only represent ourselves but we also represent the company and the employer. Also, professional employees need to remember that being professional means that in any situation it is not appropriate to say anything that would offend other employees or customers. Sometimes, employees take their personal lives to work and it sometimes cause problems to arise. There are employees who try to find other co-workers to confide in and it ends up leaking out to other co-workers and rumors spread and then problems occur. These are sometimes what causes people to say things that are wrong or shouldn't be said at all. Being humans, we tend to say things without thinking about it. Sometimes we think we are helping with the problem but we just end up making it worse. For example, from personal experience, Sam's Club is a really great place to work. You learn a lot from working there, at least i did from working in the jewelry department. But the big problem over there is people tend to get in trouble by saying things that are wrong. Like, spreading rumors about people or just saying something offending to a co-worker gets you in trouble. Especially if it deals with that persons race, religion, and anything that could offend that person. One of my co-workers was jokingly talking about the stereotypes of another country not knowing that the co-worker in the same room was from there and it offended her. The guy that made the joke got written up and got a warning. I honestly believe that it is wrong to say things that could be offending because everyone has feelings and if it's too the extreme of making someone not wanting to come back to work or something that would make the company's reputation bad then yes i believe that people should lose their jobs for it."}

In companys today, a lot of people lose their jobs from saying the wrong things, which is a lot of times related to sexual harrasment. When your work place becomes a place where you don't feel safe or want to go to anymore dealing with harrasments and all then yes it is okay for people to lose their jobs from saying the wrong things that could lead an employee to feeling uncomfortable. Just like saying offending things about someone's race is just as bad as harrassing someone at work. I know of people that lose their jobs from saying and doing the wrong things at work. Sometimes, one employee could not appreciate what you say but the other employee keeps saying it, that could get you in big trouble especially if you know that the person doesn't appreciate it. If an employee is married, and a co-worker has a crush on that employee and tries to get involved with her by saying things that could imply to her that he is trying and already knows that she is married and doesn't appreciate it then that is harrasment. If these kinds of things happen and no one corrects the employee that was doing and saying all the wrong things then that would just give the company a bad name and it would also cause the workers to not want to work at a company like that. All employees want to work at a place where they feel safe and comfortable. Also, employees like jobs that actually show that they care about them. That when they get into situations like sexual harrasment and all that the company will do anything in their power to help them feel safe. So i believe that when situations like sexual harrasment is involved or major things dealing with racial and negative things that offend people and could make a company's reputation go bad then yes people should lose their jobs for saying and doing the wrong things."}

The money from fines now goes straight to the Treasury. But when the money started rolling in from drivers caught by these new devices the authorities realised how much money can be made if they keep on planting new cameras. If it really wasn’t about the money then why have they focused so hard on an offence that causes just 5% of accidents and have done proportionally very little in preventing the other 95% causes of accidents? The PACTS reply (and the pilot study and all their other quoted analyses) is based on a gross misuse of the figures in Highways Economic Note #1 (HEN1), which gives estimates for costs associated with a road fatality, serious injury, etc and also the value of preventing a fatality (VPF). The Costs are the true costs to the county of an incident (emergency services, hospital, repairs to roads, etc. The report makes it clear that VPF includes amounts for pain, grief, loss of earnings, etc. Any use of VPF to show return on investment is bogus and potentially fraudulent. The values assigned to pain, grief, etc are hypothetical amounts that someone might be prepared to pay to bring their loved one back, and are to be used to compare alternative road schemes. Those values do not exist and would never appear on a balance sheet. To get £58M \"cost saving\" from two years of \"280 lives saved\", PACTS are using an average figure of about £100,000 as the costs of a fatality/serious-injury/minor-injury. This is a blatant misrepresentation of official government figures by a governemnt body. Further, most of the 280 reduction in KSI per year at camera sites is due to the statistical phenomenon \"regression to the mean\", in other words those 280 accidents would probably not have happened anyway, regardless of cameras. It is a fanciful number and bears no relation to reality (ask yourself how any camera can save a life!). So, with a massive reduction in costs per death/injury and a massive reduction in the number of \"lives saved by cameras\", the return on investment argument is exposed as totally bogus. I believe the \"return on investment\" in terms of safety/casualties is less than 5% per annum.

I have had unpleasant experiences with many social networks and chat rooms(surely you must think those aren't places for children, but I was curious, as any child is) I must say the idea of facebook is fantastic, but facebook itself is often abused and children are the weakest and most easily influenced members of society.Therefore, we should be protect them where protection is needed and possible.Facebook may be available to them today, but why not force this great social network to change this and have a more strict privacy and access policy."}

{"id": 2904, "content": "The government has no incentive or barometer for efficient allocation of resources. Rather than searching out arenas for profit growth, the government seeks to do damage control. Since the government does not seek profit, it has no way of telling how efficient it is in allocating resources. Unlike firms, the government cannot be allowed to fail, meaning there is no penalty for inefficiency and no competitive alternatives. Most importantly, the government is funding existing firms or projects, which are being funded because they have already failed or are on the brink of failure. We often see government expenditure touted as the fastest way to improve GDP growth. With \"each dollar of government spending\" the GDP \"increases...by only 1.4 dollars\". tax cuts attempting to help a faltering economy) are estimated to show about 3 to 1 growth in GDP. Governments can only pay off expenditures with tax hikes. The Romer study suggests that \"an exogenous tax increase of one percent of GDP lowers real GDP by roughly three percent\", a phenomenon likely caused by the fact that \"investment falls sharply in response to exogenous tax increases\". A recent example would be JP Morgan Chase Bank's 25 billion dollar bailout: a bailout they used to finance their own private acquisitions, not to make loans. They issued a statement that read \"loan volume will continue to go down as we continue to tighten credit\". JP Morgan took 25 billion but did not provide much-needed loans to small businesses, employers, and individuals which would have helped, among other things, to create jobs and improve the housing market. If JP Morgan felt they could make a profit from giving loans, they would. But all of their returns are heavily taxed to the point that making acquisitions is a safer and more profitable short-term goal, even though it does not improve the economy a bit."}
{"id": 2905, "content": "Tax cuts are more efficient because firms following their self-interest will seek investments that provide profit. With heavy corporate taxes, firms are forced to either take on too much risk to make profit which can lead to financial collapse, or they merely make safe moves and firms that make acquisitions profit more than those taking risk. This is less than desirable because too cautious or sparse of investment means that there is likely to be little growth. Additionally, the corporations that are able to acquisition are the larger which means an economy may see oligopolies and eventually monopolies form which will harm the competitiveness of the market. In addition, tax cuts are preferable because the forces of supply and demand can more freely work on their own. Firms seeking profit are more sensitive to demand than governments seeking to employ and prop up. Thus they affect supply so that the market is cleared as supply and demand meet and wastefulness is minimized. This makes for a more efficient allocation of resources and a much more sustainable economy. Both are necessary to recover from a recession."}
{"id": 2906, "content": "When trying to recover from a recession it is vital that the government encourages saving and helps provide the means through tax cuts. Savings is important because it so often takes the form of investment in the market. By the laws of supply and demand, the more investment that enters the system, the less companies need to pay to borrow. Thus it is easier for these companies to employ and expand. With tax cuts pocketed, households will be more likely to save or invest their money in greater-growth opportunities. Since tax cuts provide for a multitude of investors, the rate of failed investments will be much lower than if the government makes huge lump sum expenditures in large investments. Also, tax cuts for individuals can help households better handle temporary reduction in hours they are experiencing at the time or anticipate to experience in the near future. The less the government takes from households the more income there is to go towards balancing a recession affected budget. When a household runs a deficit it is nearly impossible for that household to increase consumption as the economy will need in order to recover."}

In that case, the person will be able to attempt in front of the judicial authorities his freedom, and return to the society. This is also adequate because judicial authorities can be wrong at the moment they condemn the person who is charged to commit terrorist acts. Anyway, even the judge is human, and he can be wrong at the moment he appreciates the facts that are not favorable to the suspect. His lawyer, maybe, is not enough prepared to make the defense (fact than can be checked in almost all the undeveloped countries) and this can lead to an adverse decision. If the suspect is condemned and the death penalty is executed, there won’t be any possible remedy to this flaw, and that means that an irreversible measure should always be a completely correct decision. A human decision, like the judge’s, that ever can be reviewed, will never be completely sure. On the other hand, imprisonment will always be a reversible measure and, as this house already stated, it can be effective to penalize a person who actually committed terrorist acts that cause death. This is wider fair, because we literally don’t sacrifice any innocent people’s right. Finally, this house strongly believes that imprisonment in opposition of the death penalty is efficient to accomplish not only the punishment but also the social rehabilitation. In that order, we erase the fault and not the person."}

That their parents can be relied on not feared; respected/loved/kind/understanding rather than unhelpful and distant. Parents themselves feel that children who talked to them about their problems can be trusted/leaned-on with their own. Thus [parents trust their children to be there for them in their time of need. This symbiosis throughout lifetimes is healthy and efficient for both parent/(s) and child/(children).

The emotion that is driving this anti-capitalist ideology is not reason and rationality but laziness and envy.

Students are discouraged from being interested in maths as they can no longer use it, it is too complicated for them to learn if they are not already enthusiastic about maths and have the right midnset for it, and it has a reputation as a niche subject for nerds. According to Professor Andrew Hodges in the Guardian article 'Who Needs Maths?' I'm sure there are wonderful examples of good teaching practice to be found in schools, but the curriculum is very prescriptive and most teachers don't have the time to be creative. We should be looking at ways of teaching maths skills through other media, such as electronic music and web design, that are more relevant to most students.\""}

People enjoy and wilfully enter into voluntary work but hate and dread their paid work, even when it largely involves performing the same tasks and one has the added incentive of pay, because they feel they have chosen to do the former while they are forced into the latter because of the need for money. Young people will do the compulsory subjects 'just because they have to', putting very little effort into them, while focussing their time on the topics that they choose to do. Making mathematics an optional subject will make it appear that it is the same as another GCSE, meaning that they will choose it because they are interested in mathematics, then be happy and motivated to study it."}

This is a daily occurrence that does affect our lives. Therefore, we should replace compulsory maths with humanities. The only maths that should be compulsory is general arithmetic. This would leave our children with more time to learn skills they will actually use throughout their lives as opposed to for one GCSE exam.

These children are disadvantaged by the current system as their arithmetic skills are being judged by a GCSE that has tested them on less essential material. If we separated arithmetic and math and subjects, then those who are good at daily additions, subtractions and multiplications would be able to show their skills via a formal qualification rather than it being muddled in and watered down with more fanciful but less useful math."}

This solution will provide the Benefit at no/little extra cost to the football authority/club. If the game is not important enough to be of interest to the media then it is not a Top Class game by default and the match officials continue as before without the technology.

To put video replays in football would deny us of this pleasure, and it would be to the detriment of the entertainment value of watching football. We may not feel good about our loss but we are moved by it, thus entertained. And there is enjoyment in mourning and yelling over a united cause. It gives people a reason to get together,rant,drink and have a good time. Targeting the referee, doodling a funny mustache on his photographs; sticking his face on a punching bag ... that sort of thing, proves to be very (immature) enjoyable.

Football is much like a film. It is filled with drama and actors. From the diving players, to the aggressive players, to the heroic captain even to the manager on the side of the pitch overreacting to the smallest of knocks or opportunities; football is all about acting. The ref plays a part in this. To add video refereeing would take away this part and would make football an incomplete display of showmanship. Counterargument: We want them to look good not bad.

In another sport, the transfers and team signings do not make big news. In football however, the transfer windows are big media hype. We want to know which club has got which players. We like to assess why managers would pick certain players over others. Most of all, we love to pass judgment on the referees decisions and his political motives behind them. Did he have an ulterior motive? Or should we complain that he is too far sighted to be a referee. Either way, we love delving into the politics. Politics isn’t perfect and neither is football. But if we marginalized the referees role, we would marginalize the political element in football, and this would make the game less analytical."}

It is for that reason that the courts encourage the use of a single joint expert for both parties rather than having two experts . This ensures that a more wealthy party cannot hire experts for vast sums of money who will say whatever that party wants them to say. The experts duty to the court is overriding and their report must state that the expert understands that his duty is to the court .

In this case, 11 years after being sexually abused, Stubbings realised that her mental disorder was caused by her uncle who committed the sexual abuse. Upon trying to sue, she was prevented.

ISPs are angry that they are being asked to police users and foot the cost of this enforcement.

Instead they should have a vision about what they want to achieve in order to be able to achieve it. While many celebrities would not be any better at this than many ministers there is no reason why they should not be at least as good at defining what they want to get out of their ministry. Counter : Self-made movie/soap-star/sitcom stars are being referred not the spoiled brat princes & princesses of the industry with their many excesses or publicity stunts in a number of cases. Every actor has to follow a script(written by someone else), be on set on call, listen to the directors and producers. But they are more than lackys/yes-men in the sense that they must improvise what is on their plate to make something of themselves, they have to be in the picture and being bland mindless drones does not help them. And it does not help ministers either, ministers need to be great public speakers and have certain ideals/beliefs that they hold dear for them to be passionate and convincing much like actors do. And only this with help them achieve objectives otherwise they could take a backseat and say nothing doing as is the case for most mediocre ministers.

There is an overwhelming public safety interest in preventing some harmful forms of speech and preventing these particular types of expression does not greatly harm me.

For we may learn false or fallacious knowledge or simply bad knowledge. For arguing through a Graduate level framework. I take pleasure every few day to watch something benificial before bed. What I recognize of even the most educational shows they are benificial only to a very general understanding of the topic. Channels such as the history channel are hardly historical and even when they are they are careless to speak with enough accuracy to discriminate between very unliklyness and truth claims. There is often a motivation to make certain topics more exciting but often with the cost of oversimplification. Moreover in attempt to reach greater audiences shows are capped at a intellectual capacity of the casual person. But for a deep level of understanding books can be particularly selected to meet the optimal requirements for the learner. For there may be use in learning basic generals of a topic. But the computer really is the better source then both books or tv. especially with the increase of e-books and the ability to select for individual capacities. But books inable to reader to learn at thier own pace and process information at a pace best for them, while a tv show requires less effort. the learner loses information when attemping to contemplate over a concept of interest for they either miss the continuing the information or do not fully benifit at the from absorbtion of information caused by deeper processing. One of the intuitive motivation for tv vs books is the effort required vs pleasure recieved. For just like any new system of understanding such as learning a new language or learning to type.. once the skill is mastered the effort required for value drops thus increasing the motivation to take advantage of the new skill. thus mastery of reading increases the rate you of value you get out of reading vs the effort put in.. That is for the unpractised reader may be more motivated for tv then books. But as you become more skilled the more you reading becomes valuable. So we may understand that the novice reader cannot percieve the value of reading from a frame work of ignorance. this is not to be taken in an evaluative meaning but rather a descriptive explanation."}

However, over the course of the last 100 years, her autonomy in this area has been significantly lessened as a result of man made climate change. Due to increased industrialisation since the turn of the century, and its emission of green house gasses such as Carbon Dioxide, the Earths average temperature has risen drastically in the last 50 years. As a result Sea levels are rising, there has been a change in the amount and pattern of precipitation, there will be an expansion of sub-tropical deserts, and the retreat of perma frost, glaciers and sea ice continues. There are also predictions of an upturn in the intensity of extreme weather, species extinction and a change to farming yields. In the United Kingdom, the ten warmest years on record are as follows: 2006, 2007, 2003, 2004, 2002, 2005, 1990, 1997, 1949 and 1999. This further demonstrates the change in climate, and it is man made phenomena. The Earths environment is increasingly being controlled less and less by Mother Nature, and more and more by us."}

{"id": 3120, "content": "Every decision to preserve a building or a site of public historical interest necessarily prevents the possibility for future developments. The resources required to redevelop an existing site are frequently greater than the resources required to produce a new development, and it is crucial whenever a site is chosen for preservation that the benefits of preserving it outweigh the potential benefits of allowing new construction to appear in its place, or for resources to be put into alternative projects. An over-zealous approach to preservation, be it through architectural listing or restrictions on certain types of development can in fact stifle growth and prevent the development of areas which may seriously benefit from new investment and growth. It is a fitting irony that in 2006 the Department of Media, Culture and Sport exempted Fortress House, the then home of English Heritage, from listing: a location which has since been redevloped into modern offices. Similarly, the recent Grade II listing of the Milton Keynes shopping centre, thecentre:mk, has drawn complaints from its owners who have argued that future developments and improvements will now be severely restricted ."}
{"id": 3121, "content": "Both charities and government agencies which seek to preserve historic sites do so with the understanding that their work contributes towards a greater social good. While what constitutes 'historical interest' will always involve contentious judgements, preservation organizations should always attempt to consider the benefits (and costs) to society when attempting to restore and maintain old sites. George Reid's report demands a thorough inventory and assessment of the National Trust for Scotland's many assets before any decisions are made, and this approach is essential before valuable charitable or state resources are invested in preserving any developments. 'Historical Interest' may be an unhelpfully vague term, but at the least it should refer to sites which the public as a whole would feel beneficial in preserving. An in-depth and public evaluation of candidates for preservation is always necessary before any work should take place."}
{"id": 3122, "content": "A key influence on George Reid's report was the fact that, in order to save a £13 million pound budget hole, four National Trust for Scotland sites had to be left to fall into disrepair or 'mothballed'. If strict priorities on what justifies preservation are not made, there is a very signficant danger of many underfunded, low profile preserved properties receiving sub-standard maintainance and eventually being left derelict. By enforcing clearer and perhaps less generous guidelines on buildings which are worthy of preservation, resources can be focussed more effectively on a smaller number of preserved properties, and can maintain a higher standard of preservation overall, even if it comes at the price of some less historically important sites."}
{"id": 3123, "content": "The study of historiorgraphy teaches us that, over time and with sufficient debate and research, historical judgements can change dramatically. If we choose only to preserve what is seen as of 'historical importance' today, we run the risk of consigning sites whose significance has not yet been fully realised to extinction. It is more than likely that, in the eyes of planners, 'historical importance' will be linked to public interest and profitability, and less well-known, accessible or immediately eye-catching sites will be lost as cuts are made. The danger of failing to preserve sites which are relatively unknown to the general public or which cannot be immediately made profitable will be especially acute during a recession and a period of cuts to government expenditure, as public organizations are placed under intense scrutiny and as autonomous profits become a key factor in historical sites' survival."}
{"id": 3124, "content": "When a category as arbitrary as 'historical importance' is chosen as the factor in preserving or not preserving buildings, final decisions will undoubtedly become influenced by public opinion on what constitutes a site of historical value. Clearly preservation organizations should operate with the public interests in mind, but inevitably, a building of historical importance for one community will be very different to that for another. It is easy to imagine popular media supporting the preservation of sites which are 'conventionally historical' at the expense of perhaps less well-acknowledged but nonetheless important buildings elsewhere. Frequently, examples of mid-twentieth century Brutalist architecture, because of their public perception as eyesores and stigmas associated with urban planning and social housing, are derided as candidates for preservation by a public and media with entrenched views on historical value."}
{"id": 3125, "content": "Preserving buildings can often bring local benefits to communities which extend beyond their value as 'heritage sites'. Frequently, certain buildings are seen as integral to the character of an area, and become places over which communities can bond through a shared asset. In particular, municipal sites such as swimming pools, town halls and parkland can hold benefits for an area which outside observers such as developers or preservation organiztions may not fully see. As councils attempt to revitalize run-down urban areas through new investment and modern building, they run the risk of depriving these areas of their individuality and cultural history which may have developed over centuries. If building preservation is given such narrow criteria, the often hidden social value of maintaining sites in an area may be tragically lost."}

This would then result in them being unable to obtain decent jobs with high salaries, leading to a resentful feeling and tension amongst the poorer of the nation and towards the rich who had never had any problem attending university and getting a well-paid career.

What's more, even if the government did have people to take up these positions, it is likely that they would not be the best people for the job. If more people were able to get a higher education, it would leave the government with more choice and more intellectual candidates to choose from.

{"id": 3156, "content": "The scale of student numbers eliminates the possibility for true personalized learning. Students are increasingly disengaged from the learning process as they come to regard it as irrelevant to them. The silent majority get by by keeping a low profile. According to Howard Gardener's \"multiple intelligences theory,\" there are nine DISTINCT different intelligences or learning styles. Linguistic Intelligence: the capacity to use language to express what's on your mind and to understand other people. Any kind of writer, orator, speaker, lawyer, or other person for whom language is an important stock in trade has great linguistic intelligence. Logical/Mathematical Intelligence: the capacity to understand the underlying principles of some kind of causal system, the way a scientist or a logician does; or to manipulate numbers, quantities, and operations, the way a mathematician does. Musical Rhythmic Intelligence: the capacity to think in music; to be able to hear patterns, recognize them, and perhaps manipulate them. People who have strong musical intelligence don't just remember music easily, they can't get it out of their minds, it's so omnipresent. Bodily/Kinesthetic Intelligence: the capacity to use your whole body or parts of your body (your hands, your fingers, your arms) to solve a problem, make something, or put on some kind of production. The most evident examples are people in athletics or the performing arts, particularly dancing or acting. Spatial Intelligence: the ability to represent the spatial world internally in your mind -- the way a sailor or airplane pilot navigates the large spatial world, or the way a chess player or sculptor represents a more circumscribed spatial world. Spatial intelligence can be used in the arts or in the sciences. Naturalist Intelligence: the ability to discriminate among living things (plants, animals) and sensitivity to other features of the natural world (clouds, rock configurations). This ability was clearly of value in our evolutionary past as hunters, gatherers, and farmers; it continues to be central in such roles as botanist or chef. Intrapersonal Intelligence: having an understanding of yourself; knowing who you are, what you can do, what you want to do, how you react to things, which things to avoid, and which things to gravitate toward. We are drawn to people who have a good understanding of themselves. They tend to know what they can and can't do, and to know where to go if they need help. Interpersonal Intelligence: the ability to understand other people. It's an ability we all need, but is especially important for teachers, clinicians, salespersons, or politicians -- anybody who deals with other people. Existential Intelligence: the ability and proclivity to pose (and ponder) questions about life, death, and ultimate realities. The national curriculum fails to cater to all of the above learning styles because the national curriculum uses model lessons (all students are taught the same things the same way)."}

Although it is not known for certain when any oil and gas peak might be it is certain to come at some point. The peak oil argument runs that we have been using oil since the 1900's at an explanentially increasing rate, this is unsustainable and at some point we will reach a point where the discoveries of oil no longer match up to demand. Once there is too little supply compared to demand we will have reached the peak. This will result in very large price increases as there will no longer be any slack in the system. At this point all kinds of renewable energy become essential, wind will also no longer be uneconomic."}

You want to hurry on your way, but you make a conscious choice to help him.

{"id": 3172, "content": "The difference, intellectually and morally, between man and the rest of the animal kingdom is vast. Unlike animals, who are pre-programmed to act in certain ways (we call it \"instinct\"), man is a creature of self-awareness (conciousness) and thus, unlike animals, is aware of the variety of choices available to him in any situation that requires a choice be made. Therefore, this makes him a creature of volition (free will). The example of a man being prompted to cross the street by a green light in order to prove that man acts as a robotic entity and not as a creature of free will is faulty. What about the person who encounters a red light at an intersection and chooses to ignore it and cross the street anyway? Or, what about the person who encounters the green light, understands that they can now cross the street because the green light says so, but does not do so because a speeding car approaches, which causes that person to decide that it would not be safe to cross the street, and they hold back because the car may not stop but proceed through the intersection instead? In either of these cases, these people had a range of choices. They could have chosen to jay-walk, for example! The \"green light\" argument above, which attempts to prove that people are not creatures of free will because the person is \"determined\" to cross the street, is simply faulty. To be \"determined\" in something is itself an act of volition (free will), and we can choose our level of \"determination\". We can be somewhat determined or greatly determined to do (or not do) something. One could argue that we do share in common some instincts with animals, such as the instinct towards self-preservation. However, even in this case, we know there are many examples of people who have deliberately ignored their own \"instinct\" towards self-preservation, and instead deliberately sacrifice themselves for a cause or a person or group of people. An example would be a soldier who deliberately throws himself over a grenade that is about to explode in order to save his comrades from a certain death. Unlike animals, man has surpassed acting on purely instinct, is a creature of awareness, and because of his greatly superior intellect and the ability to choose between actions with understanding of what the possible outcomes could be, makes him a creature of free will."}

From iron to zinc, calcium to protein; everything that is vital for a healthy young life can be found in these natural given milk ducts. The Government should make it compulsory for mothers to breast feed to ensure that every child is allowed to benefit from this.

If all of the nutrients that child needs are being gained for free, then less benefits would be needed in order to keep the child healthy.

By making breast feeding compulsory, we can reduce the levels of this occurring. Breast feeding is a bond making exercise between a child and a mother. By taking away the choice, by ensuring mothers put every effort into making sure that their child suckles, we can ensure that there are less cases of mothers feeling that they have not bonded with their child."}

In the Infant survey in 2005 it was found that one of the main reasons why women did not breast feed was because they felt they had a lack of support. If the Government made breast feeding compulsory, they would then have to look at this and put more money into medically trained people in the art of breast feeding and place more money into schemes which aided mothers through this stressful time. Such a move would greatly help mothers and children."}

However, one of the reasons that the Infant Survey found that women decide not to breast feed for the whole 6 months is due to pain. As breast feeding passes on what is in the mother’s body to the child, normal methods of pain relief are not appropriate. However, not enough research has been done by pharmaceutical companies into pain relief for breast feeding mothers. If breast feeding were made compulsory, suddenly the pharmaceutical companies would see an opportunity to sell drugs to the NHS and would start to research and develop appropriate pain relief methods for these women. This will result in many women having a more comfortable experience with breast feeding."}

Even in a system where utility equals satisfaction of interests, some people may not be working towards their own interests –they may have voluntarily subsumed their own interests entirely to someone else, or to a greater cause. Victory conditions are rarely as simple as win or lose. As with the above point, the person in this position is left at a disadvantage in the calculus simply because they are not like the majority of people.

Because it is unclear whether \"utility\" refers to: a) solely to individual (normative) preference, which, especially in aggregate, tends to be rationally inconsistent (see any basic principal of revealed preference economics example). This leads to poor (see confused) decision making long term because the aggregate makes inconsistent choices. b) some objective list of criterion of which utility is a function (like say education, nutrition, fitness). The trouble is that in an inherently pluralistic world, such an \"objective\" list is nigh impossible to obtain. It is also difficult to know, objectively, what is good for us. It is folk-knowledge that what we want and what is best for us do not always (or even often) meet. This confusion over what \"utility\" means creates a scenario in which whomever holds the reigns of power decides what \"utility\" means for everyone. It is not much of a stretch to say that this is a sub-optimal situation. By subscribing to a purely utilitarian philosophy, one more or less ensures a sub-optimal outcome in utility due to the practical implications of such calculus."}

Further, if we inspect only our toe-nails, we may conclude that the whole body is hard and white. Useful conclusions and thus perhaps useful inventions must come by sharing among specialists. Simply throwing out various discovieries means we have a pile of useless discoveries, it is only when one can make with them a mosaic that we can see that they may form a picture.

Generalists and only generalists can see a broad enough picture to realize and introduce to the world the problems of the environment. With specialization, each person focusses on their research and their goals. Thus, industrialization, expansion, and new technologies are driven ahead. Meanwhile no individual can see the wholisitc view of our global existence in which true advancement may mean stifling individual specialists for the greater good of all. Finally, over-specialization in a people's daily lives and jobs has meant personal and psychological compartmentalization. People are forced into pigeon holes early in life (at least by university) and must conciously attempt to consume external forms of stimuli and information in order not to be lost in their small and isolated universe. Not only does this make for narrowly focussed and generally pooprly-educated individuals, but it guarantees a sense of loss of community, often followed by a feeling of psychological displacement and personal dissatisfaction. Without generalists, society becomes inward-looking and eventually inefficient. Without a society that recongnizes the impotance of braod-mindedness and fora for sharing generalities, individuals become isolated.

If a parent ignores any danger that could affect their child’s health then they are guilty of neglect and should be prosecutable offence. From experience, I can say that the problem is not as much ignoring the warnings as it is a failure to control the child. Parents are not so ignorant of the medical maladies because they do see and hear the warnings. But many parents are unable to deny their children. They see the obesity as less threatening than the possibility of losing the \"affection\" of the child. Parents typically do not want to be the \"bad guy\" who must enforce the rules of positive values and will, in more cases than not, allow the child to maintain a poor diet and eat too often. I am the stepfather of a mildly autistic male who is now 20 years old and roughly 380 lbs. I've seen this played out in person and I can confidently state that, until this allowance of bad vaules is changed, this problem will run even more rampantly. If parents are unwilling or simply unable to make the necessary changes then, perhaps it is time for the legal system to step in...they would if the child were being physically abused.

We should not see people as a means to our own ends as Kant-anian theorists would say. Instead we should value people for their personality. This valuation does not revolve around asking if a person is useful to our purposes and therefore is the least self interested valuation; and therefore the correct one. Counter: I think the person who authored the paragraphs above; is confusing charity/human-kindness/selflessness with being won over by an individual's personality.The latter being self interested because 'you' need to be won over; that is(i.e), 'like' the person you're being nice to if you're judging him/her on his/her personality.

You may admire/like a person from afar because of his/her sports/academic abilities/strengths but may not like the person once you get to know him/her because of a personality clash.

Even if a person was to so radically change, it wouldn't be the same person, so it would be meaningless to compare them to the old person. When you complain about someone being mean, miserly, dishonest etc. you are asking them to act in a different way towards you eg. give you what you want - not to actually be a different person! It would be unfair to ask them to change that much. Acting in a way that you can co-operate with others in a society is different from changing your inner life.

In films where 'the hero wins' and 'the villain loses', the morality is entirely bipolar, teaching children that some people are good and some people are evil and we shouldn't question this. This kind of thinking isn't what we need in a situation where it has already caused wars. In original versions of fairy tales, the morality is often quite complex, with main characters performing evil actions, the most unsympathetic people turning out not to be evil and nothing being as it seems. Fairy-tale magic isn't something 'good' or 'bad', its something untrustworthy, a bargain that you don't know the conditions of, with dire consequences if it isn't kept."}

Taxes are needed for roads, schools, law enforcement, the military and other programs of this nature which benefit all. The above being said, there is a point at which taxation can become unjust, confiscatory and oppressive. Our Constitution was written to guide us in such matters. Our Constitution guarantees our \"inalienable rights\" which are not granted by men, but by God, (or if you choose personally not to use \"God\", then a power that is higher than mankind). These include the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We are also guaranteed an opportunity to strive for what we may gain by our own labors, whether it be material aquisition, property (land, homes) or a good education. What we are NOT guaranteed is an equal OUTCOME. Thus, when we hear ideas promoted such as \"spreading the wealth\" we need to be careful about the intention behind such a statement. Does the person (or persons) uttering such a phrase mean that we should confiscate the labors (and resulting property) of another to give it to someone else? What would be the justification for such an action? We are at a crossroads in this country in which more and more people are demanding things they feel \"entitled\" to. People have expressed that the government should pay for their college education, their birth control, their homes, and many, many other things - the list is endless. But when we say the \"government\" should pay for these things, what we are really saying is that those who produce - that is, everyone from those who do physical labor to those who run companies - should be taxed to pay for more and more things. Taken to its ultimate conclusion, there will come a point (and, indeed, this point has been reached for many) in which taxation becomes unjustly confiscatory, resulting in what we have already seen - companies hiring less workers and moving overseas; people being discouraged from working or starting businesses because they receive less and less of the rewards of their labor. We have also seen tremendous waste of our tax dollars and a lack of accounting for where our tax dollars go and what they are used for. When we look to government instead of ourselves to supply what we want or need, and government takes from one group of people to give to another, we see a leveling of the masses that begins to take place - not a leveling that takes place in a good way, but one that brings people down, not up. One that equalizes people in poverty and misery, and places them more and more at the mercy of a government that, as history has shown over and over, becomes more tyrannical over time."}

Forcing a business to go into or maintain a debt due to tax incurs a cost to the business and ultimately results in a less stable and/or competitive business. History has shown repeatedly that private enterprise is a more efficient allocator of assets than the government, as private enterprise takes in to account the relative cost of any action, reduced down to monetary terms (the profit motive).

The optimum driving speed is between 50 and 60mph[[W.H. West, FuelEconomy, 2001]], this is the most efficient driving speed to save petrol and reduce noxious emissions.

Instead of harsh punishments, beatings, and neglect, they give no consequences for their bad behavior at all. This is problematic because children both need and want their parents to set limitations for them through an authoritative parenting style. If their parents don't, they will act out in ways that are meant to get their attention. Coddling children will not prevent violence because it doesn't teach them that they need to act respectfully and kindly to those around them. If anything, it encourages more violence because the child is always allowed to get away with cruelty."}
{"id": 3405, "content": "Sometimes, children learn violence through television shows, video games, and other types of media. They might also see it at school. Since this teaches that violence is acceptable, it is up to parents to try to limit how much exposure that their kids have to all of this."}
{"id": 3406, "content": "Neglectful parenting often has an even greater impact on the violent tendencies of children than physical abuse does. Neglect can be characterized by withholding love and affection, food, and a clean, healthy environment from the child. This usually happens in households where one or more of the parents have some type of mental illness or addiction to drugs and alcohol. The children who are raised with neglectful parents have no idea how to function in a healthy environment. They are hungry, dirty, and ill from untreated health problems. And this impacts them on a deep psychological level that causes them to lash out at others through violence."}
{"id": 3407, "content": "Another set of health problems associated with eating fast food are called Functional gastrointestinal disorders which include Irritable bowel syndrome, chronic idiopathic constipation and abdominal migraine. A study published in 2016 by the University of Washington in association with the National Yang Ming University in Taiwan investigated the possibility of fast food causing these disorders. The research found slightly more than 88 percent of adolescents suffering with functional gastrointestinal disorders were frequent consumers of fast food. Their findings concluded a significant correlation between fast food consumption and functional gastrointestinal disorders. This study determined the likely cause of gastrointestinal disorder to be high concentrations of sodium, fat and sugars. Also excessive concentrations of trans fatty acids found in fast food contribute to disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. This consumption of fats and sugars coupled with a lack of fruits, vegetables, and sources of dietary fiber lead to imbalance in the natural flora required in the intestines for proper digestion. Abdominal migraine was the most common affliction associated with fast food induced functional gastrointestinal disorder. According to Migraine.com children who deal with abdominal migraines in their youth frequently suffer from migraine headaches later in life. These children are also more likely to develop psychiatric problems such as anxiety in adulthood. These life altering long term effects are further cause to eliminate fast food advertising."}

Many people who argue for religious education in school curriculums feel that they would have liked to have been offered an option as children about what to believe and to have been able to learn about the different religions that exist. The argument for children understanding about all religions is that they can have a more logical and well-rounded perspective on faith and religious beliefs so that they can choose to think and what they want to believe, for themselves, instead of it being something that they are taught as a fundamental fact by their parents."}
{"id": 3413, "content": "Many will argue that one reason why there are so many issues with religions is that people are not taught to be open about other religions while growing up. For many, religion is a very personal thing that is taught by their own family, so if they feel attacked about their religion, they take offense at it personally as it if is an attack on their family and themselves. The argument for teaching religious education in schools is that helping children to be aware of the broad spectrum of religions and how there are children just like them that believe differently will help them to separate their faith or their family's religious belief from being a personal matter of who they are. Many people have the opinion that children who are raised to learn about several different religions will grow up to be more tolerant of those who are from different backgrounds and religions—even very strict and possibly \"strange\" ones."}
{"id": 3414, "content": "Many will argue that teaching religion in school is an excellent way to teach values to children. Because many religions do have strong ethical and moral values in them, people feel that they are a great place to start for introducing ethics and morals into children's lives. Some believe that teaching the values from different religions helps to encourage personal reflection in students that teaches them to be aware of their actions and decisions and also inspires tolerance. Many would say that it also teaches them how there are different ways to believe similar things, but that all \"roads lead to the same destination.\" For those who believe in the positive side of religious education in school curriculums, the argument is that children are able to develop more than just academic skills, but also humanistic advantages by studying about religion in school."}

So i propose that we have the guidance counsler determine the dropouts along with the principal and the candidate that wants to dropout must have a valid reason and a bunch of back up points to their reason, therefore only the people that need or really want the dropout get it and not just all the lazy kids in high school."}

By providing subjective details based on genetic makeup, surely this is a sensible approach to raising patients’ individual awareness of how they could change their lifestyle to reduce the risk of getting the illnesses to which they are particularly susceptible. Dr Paul Jenkins, medical director of Genetic health points out that whilst the tests are not diagnostic; patients have a right to know whether their genes put them at increased risk of certain diseases. In the same way that knowing you have high blood pressure increases your risk of heart attack, this is an advancement of such medical awareness which will allow patients to take precautions which may reduce the risk of specific diseases.

All the best, thank you for reading my message if done so, may you and your love ones have a merry christmas indeed, and may the lord be with you, along with everyone that wont be spending christmas with their loved ones/friends/family, indeed."}

{"id": 3472, "content": "The only circumstances where a subject would not face breach action for removing a tag would be on health and safety grounds. If an offender removes or damages their tag during their curfew period, the monitoring equipment at the premises immediately sends a signal to the computer system at the control centre. By removing a tag, the offender will either receive a custodial sentence, a fine or they can even be recalled to prison. Offenders are on the tag for a reason and there is no escaping from it."}
{"id": 3473, "content": "It does not matter how many lives the electronic tagging system may save; it does not matter how much room it saves in prison: all that matters is that lives have been taken by those who have been electronically tagged. If these people had been inside prison, some young individuals would still be alive. Lewis Singleton, an 18 year-old, was brutally stabbed to death by a man who had a history of violence, and had previously burgled a residence a few days before when his curfew said he should have been at home. Lewis’s mother said: “People with a violent record shouldn’t be allowed curfew orders and liberty. If this had happened, Lewis might have had a chance and still be alive today”."}
{"id": 3474, "content": "It does not make sense that those who have served their time in prison should then be subject to an electronic tag around their ankle to ensure they stay at home during hours of darkness. Offenders who serve at least three months but less than four years can be released early, if they agree to be tagged. The electronic tag effectively extends the prison sentence."}
{"id": 3475, "content": "Of course offenders prefer tagging to a life behind bars. Whenever a tagged offender takes advantage of his freedom to commit further crimes, it attracts damaging headlines. Tagging does not in itself achieve anything, apart from confining someone to the house. If it were to be combined with a probation order, it allows offenders to be worked with in a more structured way who might have been leading quite chaotic lives. It does not really act as a deterrent."}
{"id": 3476, "content": "There have been all too many cases whereby burglars have been able to successfully prosecute people who have merely protected themselves and their family from someone is has broken the law and entered their house. Munir Hussain brought this issue to light when he was sued for beating an intruder. Mylene Klass also brought light to this issue when she waved a knife at people staring through her window and was warned that she could be sued. These are instances of ordinary decent people acting against people who have broken the law. They should not be the ones to be prosecuted. The law needs to be changed."}
{"id": 3477, "content": "The case of Munir Hussain brought the publics attention to the fact that the law of self defence as it stands offers more protection to the wrong doers than it does to the innocent people protecting their land. This is not a happy state of affairs. We should be able to protect our property from intruders. Upon entering a house, a burglar has invaded someone’s privacy. A home is not just the building; it’s the people inside as well. A man’s house is supposed to be a place of support and security. When that is breached, people feel very threatened. They need to get intruders out without worrying that they themselves will be prosecuted. The law should not protect burglars, it should not punish the victim of the crime."}
{"id": 3478, "content": "The idea of legally allowing people to attack people who enter their property is disturbing. This would be the state sanctioning violence, this should not be allowed. Legally, you cannot consent to being attacked violently. A person who behaves in this way cannot have as their defence that the victim consented. This reasoning is currently behind the self defence law and that is the way it should remain. By entering some one else’s property, you are not consenting to the consequences if they are disproportionate to your own actions. If you have only your fists you should only be hit with a fist, if you have a knife, you can be hit with a knife, if you have a gun, then all is fair in love and war. But to use violence far greater than hat shown to you, then we are allowing people to take revenge on rule breakers, but this should be left to the courts. Currently the balance of self defence and avoiding vigilantes is struck correctly, to change it would be catastrophic."}
{"id": 3479, "content": "Do not be deceived by the legal jargon. The Tories proposal would not disallow the killing of another in aid of ‘self defence’! They are permitting violence of any sort as long as it was not ‘grossly disproportionate’ to what they were afraid of in their plea of self defence. If you punch a burglar once that’s reasonable. Three, four times that’s harsh but a jury might let it go. Five, six times, that’s unreasonable and disproportionate. Seven eight punches, would the Tories state that this was grossly disproportionate the burglar who had only entered the house and showed no violence? Or would it take nine ten punches in the head to be grossly disproportionate? This would be seen by many people as a barbaric and savage attack, regardless of who it is on. What if the burglar had a knife, how many times would you be able to stab the burglar before your violence is grossly disproportionate? To exhibit such levels of violence means you cannot control your anger, and you should have no defence under the self defence rules."}
{"id": 3480, "content": "Paul Mendelle, QC, chairman of the Criminal Bar Association states that the current law works well and juries understand well the concepts that are involved in the current self defence law. Why would we seek to change the law to different concepts that might not be so easily understood? Whenever the word ‘gross’ is used in the law, people get confused. People have different conceptions and ideas about what gross means. This will cloud the law. People will not know what they can and cannot do. How can you draw the line neatly between acting disproportionately, which would be allowed under the Tories plans for reformation, and acting grossly disproportionate? The law on self defence although not enshrined in statute is widely understood and accepted. If the Tories change the law on this matter then prepare to see a hazier concept of self defence."}
{"id": 3481, "content": "Yes, politicians form part of Parliament, and Parliament sets the laws, but we should not allow them to use the law as a point scoring technique with the public. The law works fine as it is. Yes there are a few unsatisfactory results, but this was decided by peers; members of the jury. They decide the cases based on the facts. The media picked up on these cases and has turned the public against the law of self defence but they are only seeing a snippet of what the law actually does in this area. We should not change the law because there has been one high profile case that the public were disgusted by. If the law gives a satisfactory result 99% of the time, then why change it for the odd case? The only reason the Tories want to change the law is to get the public on their side. But they should not meddle with a law that works just to win votes."}

To answer both questions you would have to video everything that went on before the goal which would not be enjoyable.

However, occasions when the ball hits the cross bar and bounces down onto the line or thereabouts are considerably fewer, as for occasions when the ball bounces down and moves COMPLETELY over the line and a goal is not given.....then this is very rare indeed. Also when the ball is directly cleared off the line by a defender and was clearly a goal, such cases are very rare. How many clear occasions when the ball DEFINITELY crossed the line...and yet no goal was given can you remember? We are talking about changing the whole of the tradition, rules and nature of football for this one event which hardly ever happens. One problem here is that alot of people do not no the rule concerning ball in play. They think if the ball protrudes over the line it is a goal, this is not the case, the ball must completely crosses over the line...so that not even 1mm would hang over the edge of white line. A situation much more common than this is when linesman continuously say the ball is out of play, when it protrudes over the line, again the ball is in play because it did not completely cross (and ofetn not even the majority of it has crossed)."}
{"id": 3496, "content": "Many people think without GLT there is injustice. However, this is incorrect. This is because the referees decision and the inherent possibility of mistake is known to both teams and part of the rules. So it is fair, both teams benefit and lose from such decisions in the course of a match and over the season. Bringing in GLT makes alot of changes but will make no changes to the status quo of football. There is no team that continuously loses because of the lack of technology and there is no team that is continuously unjustifiably successful because of the absence of GLT. Rather success in football is related to more important factors in a teams control e.g. skill, speed, passing, accuracy, creativity, strength, anticipation, formations, tactics, stamina, fitness, taking chances, motivational management, tactical management etc. It is very foolish that managers and players who can't take losing blame one technological issue for their failings. They would do better not to change football like a workman blaming the tools and blaming the rules that are the same for both, and instead concentrate changing the real reasons they lost the game. Football is a game of 90mins....one debatebale goal is not the reason for the loss...rather the failure over 90 mins or so, to create more chances, score more goals and defend those goals that were scored against you. Did we hear of a team that got relegated, because they kept losing goals that were not goals due to wrong decisions about whether the ball crossed the line? Did we hear of a team that one the league because they kept getting false decisions in their favour due to absence of GLT.?"}

When two teams no the rules, i9t doesn't matter what the standard and criteria is as long as its the same for both, so it does not bring in any change in such a status of justice applied to the game. However, the more important point, is that football is a flowing game, where in theory, the ball could stay in play for 45mins without any stoppage at all. As for Tennis and Cricket then by necessity they must continuously stop, scoring in them is also continuous. They are games of stops and starts. Rugby, relatively is also a game of continuous stops and starts, due to the nature of tackling in rugby and how it is dealt with. Tennis is all about whether the ball is 'in' or 'out'. This is not the case with football, a goal can be rare, and the main factor in football is not whether the ball was over the line, rather in most cases a goal is known to clearly cross the line, it will usually remain in the net or obviously cross it. The main factor in goals being score is the play that leads to them and not the actual final stage of the ball crossing the line."}

He doesn't mean by 'the world of football' the ACTUAL WORLD OF FOOTBALL.....i.e. the thousands of football clubs all over the world plus the millions of players and supporters. However, the media is busy at the moment pumping a very one sided argument (as well as it being an irrational one) in favour of GLT, so the TV watching sheep will most likely repeat what they hear. No doubt FIFA and manufacturers will get very rich on the introduction of any such technology....endorsements etc. But all of this contradicts the idea of the South Africa 2010 world cup...opening football to the poor etc. In reality football would became a nintendo game on the pitch for the elite-rich.....with the rest of the world playing a game with very different equipment and different rules and standards."}

The kettle would take longer to boil – especially as people do not like boiling the same water in the kettle twice. Also, a microwave will only heat the cup of tea you put in there, with a kettle, people often put more water in than they will use, so power is being wasted on pointlessly boiling water.

{"id": 3515, "content": "The societal system is hugely responsible for the uneven distribution of wealth. By definition, democracy requires equal representation of all eligible individuals. Despite our claim that the capitalistic ideal of “fair” opportunity achieves equality, we often find such equality questionable if not downright non-existent. Under the status quo where the wealth gap is wide and poor or rich statuses become inherited, a child’s life is primarily determined by the socioeconomic status of his family. The private property cherished as the well-deserved merit of competition grants an incredible advantage to the next generation. A prince in the United Kingdom enjoys a luxurious life from the very birth with maids and magnificent palaces, receives the accolade, and spends dozens of million dollars on a public wedding–and the best part is that he can and does appropriate much of that cost from taxpayers’ pocket. In contrast, an African American has a higher chance of going to prison than that of going to college. Then how can someone, for just being born with a title or being related with a millionaire, have more chance of success in the society; and how can a society that allows such vicious cycle call itself democratic? The question of fairness should prompt the government to take an active stance in redistributive measures through income taxes and provision of education, including job training and employment serivces, to the poor. This takes society closer to equality of opportunity, which accords to the ideal of fairness. The ideal gives the government justification to actively make up for the societal system that causes inheritance of rich and poor statuses, of capital that creates more capital and furthers the wealth gap."}

Over 20 years that could amount to £30,000. Although that sum is high even over the course of 20 years but show the possibilities of the tax and how it could bring in more money instead of universities rising their fares.

It isn't fair that just because some parents cannot afford to pay for their children's education that those children should be disadvantaged on account of that alone. Education is supposed to open doors, not shut them. Furthermore, private school creates a segregation between children and young adults in society, which can result in bullying in some cases. If we want our children to treat everyone in society as an equal, we must all start on an equal footing. Oxbridge doesn't pick on academic standards, what a farce!

A constitution is a set of fundamental principles or established precedents according to which a state or other organization is governed. Bearing in mind that this is a debate concerning constitutional principles, the negation team believes that while defining the term \"minority group\" the principles of legal writing should be respected. Legislative texts must be clearly worded, the words themselves should derive their meaning from the official language of the nation. We define minority as a racial, religious, political, national, or other group thought to be different from the larger group of which it is part. Currently, constitutions consist of certain principles that guarantee the basic human rights to all citizens of the country, according to which all country policies must be adjusted. Sadly, the minorities in many countries are not recognized as such, and their rights to free cultural, religious, and ethnic expression are not given sufficient protection Throughout this debate, team opp. will prove that the minorities possess specific ethnic, racial and religious needs that require special recognition in the constitution. All minority groups should be listed in the preamble of the constitution, in order to guarantee the general principles of the constitution apply to them as well. The nationalities, when specifically recognized in the preamble gain protection of their identity and further protection of their rights derived from the general provisions in the constitution and eventually in the laws of the country. Only when this process is wholesome, can the diverse rights of the minorities be protected."}

Minorities pay taxes, serve in the military, serve in juries, respect the laws and the principles of the country etc. Unfortunately, certain minority groups do not enjoy the freedoms to cultural, religious, and ethnical expression as well as other political rights. We offer two examples where the specific reason for this is the lack of special recognition in the constitution. In Bosnia and Herzegovina prior to 2010 citizens were denied the right to run for high elected office solely because their ethnic origin was not specially recognized in the constitution. Only Croats, Serbs and Bosniaks had the right to run, because they were the only ones recognized in the constitution. Finally, in December The Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights, in the cases of Jakob Finci and Dervo Sejdic (BiH) brought a verdict binding the government of BIH to change its constitution and recognize minority groups specifically as the only way to ensure equal rights. This resulted in lesser protection of their rights, a steep decrease in their living standard, segregation and alienation from the society. The recognized minorities on the other hand, saw an increase in the living standards, acceptance from the majority and integration in the society."}

Substituting their transportation means may mean a decrease in efficiency, because no matter how good a public transport is, it will always take more time than traveling by your own in your car. Even if the delay is minimum, let’s say 20 minutes more than a car journey per trip, a person who needs to attend to 4 different meetings in a single day will require more than an hour more than if he had travelled by car. Quite an elevated price to pay."}

Same applies with the main roads of a city, and that is what the Proposition tries to implement. As we have already said, through the CBDs transit many cars, not only those of the people that work there, but also people that live around and want to go to any other place, or people that cross the city. Actually there is more people that transit those streets than those that actually go to CBDs that, as we have raised, are small. And yes, we stand on our point that the traffic is not bad within CBDs because people don't take cars to travel 200 meters (the majority of the World's CBDs are less than a kilometer long). Does the proposition really think that people use cars when they can just arrive in one or two minutes walking? That's not the case, the traffic is caused by everyone that transits around the city and needs to go through the center (from east to west, north to south...). Now picture all the people that want to move within the city blocked! The only result will be total chaos of a city! The people will need to look for alternative routes (that will be even more jam packed, since they are not built to receive traffic, unlike those that pass in CBDs) and if there are none, then the government will need to build other roads (which is almost impossible) just to avoid those 600 meters that are the main artery of the city. It will just be a ridiculous policy. Now, on the point of security, we don't say cars are perfectly safe (so of course the Proposition can raise hundredths of hypothetical crimes committed against car drivers) however in public transportation you are exposed and vulnerable, unlike cars, where you can go unnoticed and less of a target (specially in those traffic roads without traffic lights), and in cases of high profile people, they may need bodyguard cars that ARE NOT public as the Proposition tries to say, since those services are not provided by the state."}

By regulating brothels and the conditions for prostitution through regular health checks, condoms et cetera, we can make sure prostitutes are safe from HIV. In places where prostitution is illegal, it is merely driven underground; controlled by cartels and gangs. In this situation prostitutes live under no rights. If a sex worker contracts AIDS, a man or woman client using them will be at risk of contracting the virus, they then run the risk of not knowing that they have it, infecting other sexual partners and the cycle continues. Also let us not forget future children who contract the disease while in the uterus. So it is in countries where prostitution is illegal where we can’t keep sex workers safe from AIDS. In these countries prostitutes aren’t even allowed to be prostitutes. They tend to enter the profession because they have no other way of earning money or they may be forced to do it. On the other hand, if prostitution is legal and regulations are put in place, sex workers will be safer from STI’s and HIV/AIDS. Regular health checks will pick up any possible infections and there will be laws to protect the well-being of sex workers. What’s more, these laws will not only protect sex workers, but their clients too. Making prostitution legal will improve the work conditions of people who have to go into prostitution for one reason or another and will protect society from a further spreading of HIV/AIDS.

They most definitely will be. It is important that prostitutes and safe and free from harm. There are many reasons why women go into prostitution. Often it is due to financial desperation and/or children commitments. These women are in a very vulnerable position and it is very important that we ensure they are as safe and healthy as can be. Prostitutes are subject to gangs, violence, drugs and rape. Prostitutes are often forced to take drugs by the gangs who employ (or own) them so as to make them addicted. This means they have no way to escape. When the market is legalised, it is no longer controlled by gangs. This is because legal businesses operate the industry instead. This is better for prostitutes as they no longer suffer the horrific abuses that they face under a system of illegal prostitution. This is because legal businesses face regulation. They are required by law to ensure that contraception is used by their employees. They are also required to ensure that their employees are healthy by directing them to appropriate medical treatment when it is necessary. When legal its easier to monitor. This is because the government knows how many prostitutes there are, where they are located, and what issues are affecting the industry. This is beneficial as the government can better plan appropriate health and social policies. Prostitutes are legitimate stakeholders that need protection. Under our model, we better protect prostitutes. They are safer, they are healthier, and they are happier"}
{"id": 3585, "content": "The problem with the opposition proposal is that it is not mutually exclusive to legalising prostitution. It is perfectly possible for a Government to provide an education program and legalise prostitution at the same time, in fact that is what is done in places like New Zealand where prostitution is legal and we provide sex education in schools. In fact, legalising prostitution actually helps a wider education program. If the opp wants people to be properly educated about AIDS, then they should not want to exclude and stigmatise sex workers. If you continue to ban prostitution, then it actually entrenches the idea that prostitutes are somehow lesser people whose welfare we shouldn't care about when it comes to HIV. As it is, countries that ban prostitution make no effort to protect prostitutes at all. To have a free and open discussion, it is necessary to allow a free discussion about prostitution, which can only happen if it is legal. If it is not, it is much more difficult to acquire information about prostitutes and about the conditions in which they work, because they are less willing to come forward and admit to what they are doing. The opp has conceded that there is a problem of people having unsafe sex with prostitutes, and yet it seems like the only group of people they want to exclude from their education program are the prostitutes themselves. If we can identify who the prostitutes are, then we can educate them. If prostitution is illegal and forced underground, we can't provide them with info. In addition, we can't provide information with people who use prostitutes, both because they won't admit to committing an illegal act and because banning prostitution increases the stigma on these people. The prop has missed the point entirely when they say we will be unable to enforce regulation, because it will be in the interests of the prostitutes and brothels to abide by regulations and report those who don't."}

{"id": 3602, "content": "There are many reasons why physical punishment does not work in disciplining children. Firstly, children tend to mimic their parents. This is because they respect them, love them and they are the example of adult behavior they are most often exposed to, which children then assume is ‘normal’. This is harmful to a child’s development because they see that bigger, stronger people can hit smaller, weaker people, and that is seen as OK because the authority figure in a child’s life is the one who does it. This means children are more likely to find it acceptable to hit their younger playmates in school or younger siblings, for example. Hitting also indicates to children that violence is the solution to resolving conflicts. Even if parents teach negotiation and principles of fairness, for most children negative memories of being hit are more prominent than positive ones of explanation are. So, it is likely that children will overwhelmingly remember the use of force to end arguments rather than the message behind it and relay this on the playground. Children don’t see the causality of their actions properly when they are physically punished. Rather than watching a girl cry when you steal her toy, if a child is punished he/she will associate certain actions with pain. Even if parents give an explanation of why the child behaved badly, the pain is the overwhelming sensation and this prevents the child from internalizing the parent’s message. They never understand the harm they do to others and only think about their actions through how it relates to them. This can lead to anti-social behavior in all social situations as children don’t even consider other people’s feelings in their relationships with the outside world. They also associate pain with the times when they are caught being naughty. This suggests that there is nothing inherently wrong in a crime, but only a painful result if caught, which encourages young people to do what they can get away wit"}
{"id": 3603, "content": "The sciatic nerve is located in the buttocks, and spanking, can cause bleeding in the muscles that surround it. This can cause long lasting injuries. A child’s ability to use their legs can be effected as nerves and soft tissue are damaged. Spanking can injure the tailbone and sacrum. The force of a smack effects the entire spinal column, and can result in disc compression or compression fractures of vertebral bones. A child’s hand is also vulnerable. Hitting can damage tendons, blood vessels, nerves and ligaments, which are all located close to the skin. Following an attack, the child’s adrenaline output increases too. Following repeated attacks, the child's endocrine balance fails to return to baseline. This results in the child becoming prone to poor impulse control, becoming easily angered, and prone to spontaneous violent outbursts. The risk of these effects is increase because, as previously explained, spanking is ineffective. This means that the parent and child become set in a repeating pattern of children misbehaving followed by more spanking. The parent will often become frustrated at spanking not working, meaning that the frequency and intensity of the violence can increase, and the child is placed at greater risk. The risk to the child is also greater, because the parent is frequently angry / in a state of heightened emotion when they are hitting the child. As the child gets older and bigger, the parent feels that they need to use more violence to discipline them. There are emotional effects for the parent. The parent is often reminded of traumatic episodes in their life when they were hit. The parent often feels powerless after spanking their child - because the spanking doesn't work. For the child, the relationship with the parent becomes one ‘based on the fear of being hit.’ This creates distance between the parent and child. If you fear being hit, it becomes harder for parents and children to raise and deal with issues."}
{"id": 3604, "content": "Children unable to express themselves with words, will often try and draw attention to: a lack of routine and structure, needing more sleep, suffering from an allergy or illness, feeling hungry, needing exercise, wanting individual attention, wanting an intellectually stimulating environment, or simply needing more affection and love. Children will do whatever it takes draw a parents attention to these needs. They may start running around and making lots of noise or even pick a fight with their siblings. In all these cases, the child is not being 'bad' and doesn't deserve to be hit. It is more productive to try and identify and eliminate the cause of their child's stress. Sometimes this will be easy e.g carrying healthy snacks for when the children get hungry, or child proofing a home so that children cant access things that they are not supposed to. In other cases, it may require the parent to rethink the way they act around their children and how they have structured / planned out their children's lives. Obviously, even the most perfect parents will have children who misbehave, but the seriousness of the misbehaviour and the frequency of misbehaving can be greatly reduced. In instances where a child is being unreasonable, despite a parent attempting to do all of the above, parents can use time outs. Sometimes ignoring some behaviour (so long as it not dangerous) can be effective. In older children, the root cause of misbehaviour can be discovered through asking the child, and again the real problem can be tackled, which does not happen when a child is simply smacked."}
{"id": 3605, "content": "It is not physically possible to monitor every action of every child. Some spontaneous actions which may be unsupervised by the nearby guardian may require the attention of a stranger. In such cases it the action of the stranger may be violent and unwillingly resort to physical chastisement. Such incidents cannot be classified under scrutiny. Instead the unwilling volunteer performs an act of Good Samaritan. Though the right thing to do would be inform the concerned authority, it is very important for every citizen to remember their duties in times of such scenarios. There may be several instances where adults have to use physical force in order to avoid even greater violent accidents which may or may not be deliberate. For instance, if a child is holding a brick and is about to smash a vehicle’s glass, then the adult nearby will have to rather firmly grab the child in order to avoid the vandalism. In this case the adult cannot be accused of physical chastisement even if the child complains regarding the use of violence upon him in that immediate situation. Such acts of Good Samaritan invokes the guardian to be more careful from the next time, not only the guardian, even the child, when handled by a stranger, instills an feeling of shame and humility and declines on doing the same thing in the future."}

The government has 'no' choice in the matter. Or if the government does not meet their demands, it looks as though it is ruthless and totalitarian. But it still looks irresponsible from the get-go, for letting this happen. The media is always more critical of governments, as governments are critical of each-other.

Unless civilian populations can be made aware of terrorist acts and cowed into fear by them, terrorism can never achieve its aims. Therefore, denying terrorists such publicity discourages focus on their demands ensuring they do not succeed in bringing illegitimate public pressure to bear on governments. Terrorism promotes fear in hearts and minds and without the media, terrorism cannot succeed. If you deny terrorists publicity, you prevent terrorism from achieving its goals.

This fear can license much greater infringements of civil liberties than are actually justified.

Negotiation due to public opinion would only reinforce terrorist organizations to continue their reign of terror. States do not and should not negotiate with terrorists."}

Instead, publicising terrorist attacks can actually provide the public with information which may assist in national security. Airports continually asks the public to be involved in awareness of their surroundings. Information about terrorism strengthens the value of these requests. There is no clear relationship between publicity about terrorism serving significant recruitment purposes and instead we can see how information may better prepare the public against terrorist activities."}

Taking them out of the shops will leave greater problems since many people smoke because they are addicted and not because they enjoy it. Making something illegal is of course easier than it seems. We must weigh in not only the reasons why, but also how are we going to implement a certain set of provision. We have to realise that making something illegal does not automatically solve a problem, instead it might create even more problems as a repercussion to such a decision. Making illicit drugs such as heroine, cocaine, etc. was agreeably a good decision. However, the consequences of making such commendable decisions also involve the allocation of large amounts of state resources (read: tax payer money) to combat illegal drug trafficking. Apparently, making these drugs illegal did not really stop people from using the drugs (fyi: drugs are still a lucrative business, if not why would people risk their lives to smuggle it). That said, the same goes for cigarettes, I don't see any strong reason that making cigarettes (or smoking them) illegal to be of any use in the context of making people quit the bad habit. People who smoke are addicted to it, and as those people who are addicted to illicit drugs, they will always find ways to circumvent the law. Making smoking illegal does not automatically make the business less profitable. As I see it, the demand for cigarettes are still high everywhere, and this kind of policy would only create \"black markets\" for the item. This in turn would put burden on the law enforcement to combat such black markets (read: more personnel, more funds needed), and of course these burdens would be passed on to tax payers who pays for all the cost of faithfully enforcing such a new law. I believe that the restrictions and requirements which are already in place (i.e. restricting smoking areas, limited advertisement methods) are sufficient enough to tackle the problem. Moreover, the current approach is right on track where the government should sponsor and support policies that would decrease the demand for cigarettes (if the demand for cigarettes were to fall substantially, the business would be less lucrative, and soon enough nobody will be in the cigarette business). This is not a policy that would effectively reduce the demand, simply making it illegal is not addressing to the demand problem.Thus, what I see in this is another burden for the state budget, with little or minimal impact on the real issue at hand."}

There are quite a few problems with military action apart from that it cant always be used due to politics. The most obvious is that it is an immense step up from diplomacy. The country you are going to attack needs to have done something serious to be able to justify an attack. Even if it is justifiable there are problems. Military action relies upon your country being powerful and being able to engage in military action - whereas anyone can implement some form of sanctions - and it is very costly. This is not only of course in terms of monetary cost to your country but also in lives lost and destroyed. There can also me many unintended consequences. You can intend the action to be a small police action but there is no guarantee that your opponent will see it that way so he may well strike back escallating towards full scale war. At the other extreem your actions my push a country towards falling appart and becoming a failed state. Yes it provides a very powerful tool for changing a state's behaviour but most people would believe that it is not worth keeping the possibility of military action while getting rid of sanctions.

What people choose to do to mark the occasion is their own business. No one obligates them to buy presents. It is possible to celebrate Christmas giving simple gifts at the end of a relaxed family meal, or possible to burn out one's overdraft and credit cards buying opulent gifts and an expensively showy meal for extended family. No one makes anyone choose either of those options, or any other. Advertising naturally encourages people to take one option over the other; businesses want to make money, so of course they subvert the meaning of Christmas into being about buying as much as is possible for as many people as possible. They do not hold anyone down and force them into it. Admittedly there is a lot of psychological pressure placed on parents, in particular, to buy as much as they can, but it ultimately comes down to their own decision whether to shop or not. Even if someone does buy more than they can afford, the word 'scam' is not accurate to describe this. The word implies that people are spending money on something which ultimately is not as promised, and cons them. They are spending money on gifts, which they then give to people, who then use the gifts. This is a valid transaction for all parties. The central point, however, is that without any purchases at all, the concept of Christmas would still stand. There would still be religious celebrations. There would still be family meals, where people gather together to be close to each other. This seems to imply that it is not a scam."}

Not only are they a small minority anyway, they are more difficult to diagnose because the female social role encourages women to hide behaviour traits that would lead to a diagnosis of autism, and the fact that almost every single stereotype of an autistic person is male, while female autism is actually very different to male autism, means that people who see a woman with autism might not associate them with stereotypes of autism."}

In the end she did her research and discovered she was wrong, however, she insisted to the parents of the student that he should serve his detention for disrupting the class. If said student had to serve a detention for \"disrupting the class\" he should also receive some kind of credit toward his final grade for helping teach the class, because in the end the kids would have been taught incorrect information and would have left that classroom poisoned.

{"id": 3796, "content": "Implementing a high tax for mining and extraction in resource rich nations will lead to a spread of such taxes being implemented throughout the world and will create a standard of high tax on resources on a global scale. However doing this will not, in the global reality we live in, “redistribute a portion of the wealth gained in mining and resource extraction” in a fair, sustainable and reliable way that directly adds value to the lives of a nation’s people . Also, the Prop propose that introducing such high taxes will reduce the ever-growing gap between the rich and the poor. However, in reality, such tax would only further push the poor into poverty and increase the wealth of the rich as the mismanagement of funds cannot be guaranteed by many nontransparent nations in the world . This is counterproductive to the purpose that the proposition wish to achieve through the implementation of this tax. One of the major issues that we as the opposition have been continuously reinforcing is the trust involved in implementing such tax. It is clear that many resource rich nations have a lack of transparency in their governments’ desicions . By giving them access to such tax funds we cannot be sure that they will use it to directly help their people. Instead it is more likely that they will be using this tax to further line their pockets as corrupt nations make up well over half of the world’s countries We cannot give such a huge responsibility to societies where corruption occurs every day, rather we need to place pressure on companies to act responsibly."}

They have even said, “ is the main point of this debate.” While we have continuously urged them to consider the welfare of citizens as well as the economy of a nation they have simply refused to negotiate on the real-life effects that high taxes would have on multiple stakeholders on both a domestic and global scale. The unfortunate truth is that we live in a volatile global reality, where corruption and mismanagement of government budgets are both a reality for over half the world’s nations . We have provided evidence on the corrupted nature of many resource rich governments and this proves this is a problem that must be considered when looking at the effectiveness of implementing these high taxes. We have also continuously pointed out that one of the main issues associated with implementing a high tax in resource rich nations is the trust that can be held in their governments. We have raised this question a number of times and all we have heard in response is that “if governments... are not interested in the welfare of their people, this is a problem beyond the scope of our motion”. We feel this is in fact a major problem that must be dealt with prior to establishing a new global norm of high taxation on mining and extraction industries as the negative implications and costs to the majority of resource rich countries will be too great. The realistic social and political impacts that the implementation of such tax will have on ALL stakeholders involved has been considered by us but ignored by the prop. The Prop have also graciously agreed that by implementing a high tax “the companies will buy less in order to stay within their budget.” This only proves that the implementation of such high taxes will mean that companies will be forced to reduce spending on current technologies and practices rather than encourage investment in developing new, environmentally and economically sustainable ones. The Prop have made several unsubstantiated assertions throughout their argument and they have ignored the realistic negative effects that we have proven to exist. In particular the rise in the cost of commodities would devastate the people of those nations as well negatively effect both import and export profits. There are better ways to achieve what the Prop has proposed and this must be achieved through incentives and pressure on companies rather than simply increasing tax."}

The rebuttal presupposes that an individual needs to wait for a hypothetical existence of a treatment being developed on an assumption that decisions that are finalized is not a justification for terminating a patient's life at one's explicit consent. If decisions made in your life were to be stagnated each and every time in order for an opportunity to arise everytime, the basis for this principle would not be a good one at the very least.

An indecisiveness for something which might not exist within one's lifetime would make a claim for which things ought to be reversible or decisions ought to be remade in order for things to be \"controlled\" in a manner. In this respect, of the practice of \"Euthanasia\", death is the ultimate goal of avoidance and thus a finalized decision of upholding pain until the very last minute of life in respect to waiting for a treatment outweighs the ultimate outcome of death. The opposition makes a claim that reversibility of a decision that may be regretted later due to it being finalized is better on these grounds, however, if life was controllable in all aspects and under all possible circumstances, we were able to scroll back on our decisions, what meaningful would arise out of the circumstances for which our decisions are made on? What would the product of our actions, time and energy be? Aren't these decisions philosophically what identify us as who we are even to the extent of a life or death situation? Also, even if a cure was possible, what complications will arise thereafter? What if the patient is of old age and will die anyways but has already lived a long healthy life? It cannot be justified to deem that waiting for something which might or might not exist in a future to occur outweighs the prospect of pain. Wait for a miracle \"cure\", wait for a revolutionary science \"discovery\" to solve our problems, wait for a technological \"innovation\"...this line of thought may be wise in some situations but not necessarily in the case of Euthanasia."}

Drug companies are trying to develop cures for cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes and more , and will likely want to develop more cures for illnesses that come up in the future, as they did for swine flu, if they can get a return on the investment. If there is not a significant return to investment, a company will not bother to continue to research and develop these drugs. Even if the current drugs were released for generic development, lack of future drugs would cost far more lives in the long run, and save money on alternative treatments . Furthermore, most things that cause illness, such as viruses and bacteria, develop so that they can resist drugs . We have seen this in the case of the increased ineffectiveness of antibiotics. Prop wants to change the focus of drug production from the development of new drugs to the cheaper production of drugs that already exist. This will happen because any start-up company or investor in the drugs industry will see that it is cheaper to simply create the drugs, rather than put money into research and development, which is the most expensive part of the drugs creation process . If there is a greater focus on this, then less new drugs will be created to combat the illnesses. This structure begins to look very flawed as the illnesses develop resistances to old drugs.

Through government support, more of the population will be able to be entrepreneurs to create new businesses. Job creation is the redeeming quality of companies. The role of companies in the economy is to decrease the rate of unemployment and to see money being circulated in the economy, since people will have stable employment. Govts in general are obligated to regulate the economy as it is focused toward the people and to be free of any corruption or unethical practices. The role of taxes as well as government is to generate sufficient revenue to finance public sector activities toward the citizens, and employees. A government should prioritize its concerns about corps to better their citizens. Taxes also fulfill the need and desire for increased public services, and the capacity to levy taxes effectively. People do not like to pay them. Govts do not like to impose them…While necessary, taxes impose real costs on society. Good tax policy seeks to minimize those costs.” Especially in situation with less regulation and tax cuts are going to be actuated, more corps seek chances to exploit their workers, manipulate their investments, and go against human rights. The investment and financial resources, which would be in the hands of big corps, does not fall to the hands of workers or citizens. Regulations and taxations are a means for governments to scrutinize companies and make sure that they have standards on employment and practices. Govts are not only involved in economics but also mandated to reflect many other social factors too including concerns about fairness and feasibility in dealing with their people. While individual corps is interested soley on profits, govt should examine the big picture and try to impact the economy holistically."}

In addition, since bribes negatively affect corporations’ competitive position, it is their interest to report irregularities and apart from the existing legal frameworks stipulating public procurement issues, for instance, there is no need for extra-rules that add more to the same. Anti-bribery should become a strategic CSR priority for corporations, not another tool for governments to control the business environment, by creating more harm than actually the root-cause."}

In countries with rampant corruption, bribe has been unofficially legalized because there’s a problem with the demand. Our philosophy is that quantity in anti-bribery measures does not rightly address the corruption problem, but strategy does. When it comes to bribe, we already have a legal framework holding accountable companies for fraud, tax evasion and unfair competitive behavior. What anti-bribery laws try to impose now is a preventive mechanism that the company is responsible for. This basically equals with a preemptive tax each corp has to pay for ensuring that its employees will not be corrupt. This involves email scanning and surveillance which can set a medium company on the verge of bankruptcy, just because it has to be precautious in front of the prosecutors. Finally, In those countries where there’s an anti-bribery law on corporations,they would surely preffer cooperation to prosecution, creating more space for inappropriate government interventions, and thus feeding the demand."}

But following the proposition, we will only rely on the corporations’ good will, plus we won’t be able to act significantly against corruption. Without corporate law, we can only sue individuals for criminal acts, but the nature of corporations might make this impossible. Corporations are multinational entities, spread through different cities and states, with byzantine structure that could confuse any investigation - who has acted on any action, and by who’s authority. By acting through a number of internal & external middlemen the corporation can hide its trail. Only by treating the corporation as an independent legal entity can we connect the dots and get the ability to sue for the crime. The more actors cooperate in a bribe, the harder it is to prove that anyone of them has breached every clause of the law in the needed way to show a criminal offence. The moment that several branches of a corporation commit a crime as a whole, but each branch only commits a part of the crime, then we cannot find individual culpability, while the complete entity is still responsible for a crime. More than that, the ability of the state to act against offenders abroad is very limited, while corporate law allows it to hurt the corporation where it’s vulnerable - its bottom line. This allows the state not to punish the low-level employees pushed to crime (as demonstrated in our corporate culture point), which doesn’t significantly harm the corporation, and so doesn’t deter future crimes. Instead, corporate law, which puts fines or even forbids a guilty corporation from trading in a country is exactly the type of needed deterrent - In order to prevent & punish corporate malfeasance, we need to view the corporation as whole both for the purpose of criminal investigation, and punishment."}

The proponents of inheritance tax tend to claim that the tax will make the situation among people more just and equitable, because your odds of success in the society will depend less on pure luck (the wealth of your parents) and more on your skill and talent. Why should you be wealthier just because you were lucky enough to be born in a prosperous family? Although we hold in esteem equality and we believe that it is valuable per se, we strongly condemn the atrocious attempts to limit opportunities for some people just for the sake of achieving equality. Taking away person’s inherited wealth to achieve equality of opportunity in comparison with others is equivalent to putting out all newborns’ eyes just because there was one who was born blind. We declaim against such acts of social engineering and find them unacceptable in a free and open society. Another popular notion is that the heirs do not deserve the inheritance, because they did not earn it by themselves. But we definitely do not see the government as the worthy one to get a share of deceased’s property. In our society we generally accept the notion that a man is free, he has a free will and the ability to dispose his private property in a way he wishes to. This includes choosing who will get his property after his death. We believe that government is here to protect our fundamental rights. We do not see in what way taking away a share of inheritance is protecting rights. It is nothing less but an arbitrary act of coercion against the will of the deceased."}
{"id": 3815, "content": "One of the fundamental powers driving human behavior is the care for relatives. Throughout life, individual tries to earn a fortune not only because he wants to have a shelter and some food, but also because there is a social circle of other people around him – a social circle that he cares about. Most of the people assert that family is something that is of higher importance than anything else in their life. A person devotes time to his family, helps in various situations; finally, he wants them to inherit his wealth after death. In a way, a child is a continuity of one’s life and a person is happy to leave his property the children or other relatives. We believe that if individual was to care only for himself he would never want to work as much (and by this, create value for society as well). Ability to generate value not only for him but also for his children gives more incentives for an individual to work harder. This is beneficial for the whole society, because more work creates more value overall. However, by imposing an inheritance tax we reduce the incentives for a behavior which is beneficial for society. We discourage people from doing it. When tax is taken, money will end up somewhere else. But it is certain that people will never be as motivated to work for unknown person’s good as much as for their own relative’s good. To sum up, by taking away a share of person’s property after his death, we are indirectly preventing him from creating value for the society, because he will know that what he earns will be spread over many strangers instead of relatives after his death."}

The desire of theirs to make a fortune makes the lives of everyone easier and better. What we want to have in our society is a better environment for entrepreneurs where they can sustain their businesses – the businesses that are value-adding to the society as a whole. Estate tax is something that effectively destroys family businesses. We definitely do not claim that it is happening in all an every instance, but there are cases where such taxation is disruptive to businesses. Consider a family business of substantial value. It has been successful for many years, expanding at a rapid pace. The owner was happy to finance the expansion with retained earnings – but now he finds himself in trouble, because in case of his death, his son would not be able to pay without selling a share of his business. These are the situations we are extremely discontent with, because people who create the most value in our society are unjustly punished. Scientific studies show detrimental effects of inheritance taxes to entrepreneurial activity. Holtz-Eakin finds evidence that entrepreneurs would decrease business expansion if they would be subject to estate tax after death. This is very plausible indeed – when business owners are subject to tax, they will not expand their business so much, instead, they will put away some money so that they could be used in case of owner’s death to pay the estate tax."}

Current unemployment benefits system fails because it has incorrect goal for the unemployment benefits and doesn’t serve its needs. The current system only gives monetary rewards for job you have done in the past and with condition that you are searching for a job. However the existing conditions do not achieve the goal of the program as many individuals decide not to work for a prolonged period and instead choose life on the welfare payments. The goal of unemployment benefits is secure proper ground for people who seeking for a new job and willing to become employed again and the program should be designed to reward the work searchers and discourage those that abuse the system. The group of people who should obtain those benefits is the one that are seeking the job but because of some reasons are not capable of getting it. Unemployment benefits help this group to exercise their opportunities while having enough funds to retrain and secure the living costs. As this group is incentivized but for some reason is not capable of exercising this opportunity, government has to help. We believe people mustn’t receive money just for the sake they have worked before. We still recognize that we have to take care of your basic needs if you are not capable of securing them, but we believe monetary funds should serve for the purpose of exercising your opportunities not as reward system. The harm of reward system is that it’s not incentivizing people to get back in job market while simply paying for not working. Opposition might argue that we already have reward systems i.e. But even in these cases we say these people receive money not because they have worked their whole life but because they are the age when they cannot secure their needs on their own and government has to help by monetary helping them."}

However, while a working person contributes to society, an unemployed one parasites on it. As we have mentioned in the beginning, we believe this is wrong. The state brings numerous benefits to an individual throughout her life; thus, when she chooses not to work, though she can, the state is justified if not force her to work, then at least regulate her consumption. Our plan would remind the unemployed that their condition is not normal and show them that they are not eligible to things other than basic needs because they do not contribute to society. This would motivate the unemployed to find a job as soon as possible in order not to get exiled from society.

{"id": 3830, "content": "We see unemployment benefit as a social contract. When a person shares a part of his income with the society by giving it to the government in the form of taxes, he also acknowledges that the society can make a better use of this money for the whole society than the individual himself can. Why would an individual care for the society and the good it can do with money? Because the individual enjoys protection of his individuality which stems from being a part of the group. This protection comes in the forms of police, access to medicine and drinking water, and even the military force. Upon agreeing to be a part of the society and share part of income with it, individuals do not only get a right to be protected by the society when they lose their job in order to not be exposed to starvation and lack of shelter. Individuals also get an obligation to use this protection for the purpose the society has intended to. In the case of unemployment benefit it is simple – to get by for until their search for a new job concludes successfully and the person can sustain himself and family on his or her own. However, now more people choose to receive unemployment benefit while not working at all. In their minds the benefit becomes their salary for being unemployed, and can be spent on whatever they want, like a holiday trip, while essentially it is not their salary, but society’s protection, which in this case is misused. If an individual misuses the protection awarded to him, the society has the authority to enforce sanctions on him in order to incentivize him to fulfill his obligations. For example, if you burn your own insured house, the insurance company will not pay you anything, despite the large premium you have paid to them over the years. In a likewise fashion the society has a right to establish incentives which benefits the individual and the society in the long run."}

The opposition thinks the unemployed should just wait until the economy recovers by itself and starts offering wonderful job opportunities they were dreaming of. No one is willing to work for a minimal wage. The difference between receiving the benefits and working for a minimal wage is that the latter is a productive activity bringing benefits to the economy. The government could also use the tax revenue to boost the economy further. This process starts a chain reaction of working, earning, and spending, which revives the economy. The opposition doesn’t understand how work places are created in the economy. It is wrong to say there is no demand for labour. There could be no demand for the labour at the wages the unemployed demand. Companies can earn more by producing goods in other regions where people ask for less, boosting the economy there, for example in the South East Asia. Unemployed here demand too much for their level of productivity, so they are not competitive and are not worth the wages they wish for. Moreover, many of them are simply unskilled. It is easy to sit doing nothing receiving benefits and wining about the state of the economy. It is hard to motivate yourself to accept a job offer below your level of expectations or improve your skills.

Those people eligible for unemployment benefits have all once been employed full time, and it was not their fault that they got laid off. Furthermore, the idea of limiting freedom of choice as a means of forcing people to search for jobs is both contrary to democratic beliefs and debilitating. According to the democratic ideology, the state must serve its people. While it seems that the government is rescuing its people from destitution, it is, in fact, sacrificing people’s needs for better economy. Does the government really have rights to use people’s money however they want? Vouchers impose limitations to where people can shop. When such a high percentage of the population is unemployed, forcing these people to shop at large chain stores would negatively impact revenue for small local businesses. Those people who prefer to support small businesses would be unable to do so. Unemployment benefits are reserved for the case of economic emergency. Therefore, the government has no jurisdiction on how the benefits are to be spent. With cash, unemployed people can maintain better life quality altogether with basic necessities, which is why they have saved and paid the government 1.5% of their income.

We have proved earlier that vouchers are not the best way of dealing with unemployment. In fact, the proposition even said that “the longer the period of unemployment is, the smaller the chances of coming back.” We the opposition agrees with this point. This proves that educated people already have the incentive to get back on their feet because they know that their chance of returning is slim as their unemployment period extends. Yes the vouchers will force people back into jobs, but that is not the right way to solve for the issues in this debate. In fact, it will exacerbate the situation because the high-skilled people who are unemployed would have to find whatever job they can due to vouchers and also to be less shameful. They would even resort to working minimum wage jobs which would lead to more unemployment and a deficit to the healthy economy and the society as proven earlier in the debate. Their plan of using vouchers to take away the freedom of choice concerns side opposition. Freedom of choice is one of the main pillars of democracy and the backbone of human rights.

Since local markets don’t have vouchers, gov needs to focus on them. They noted people often buy from big retailers anyway. This is why public expenses in SQ local markets are necessary. They claim that we didn’t prove how all those shops would go bankrupt. Well, the economic recession in SQ has stricken lots of businesses. While the unemployed people are only a minority, the impending recession puts vulnerable local shops on the brinks of bankruptcy. Vouchers would only worsen SQ. Also, their claim about gov protection of economic backbones explains why they’re being supported in SQ. Thus our focus is really on those many local markets, vulnerable to economic recessions. Then they bring up anti-monopoly agencies and competitions among companies, but due to the consumers’ increasing dependency on big corporations, demands go up, jacking up the price as the rule of supply & demand. They claim that vouchers and SQ benefit are essentially the same. However while money circulates in markets with expenses benefiting millions, vouchers are only applicable to one corporation. SQ works as a “double benefit” by letting people spend their money on crucial things other than survival needs, like job creation by healthy economy. They’re still mixing welfare systems with unemployment benefits. Unlike reward systems, benefits sustain people’s lives while allowing them to use it for other needs until a job is found. Their lower class with little rights to benefits claim is very biased. These people met the standards for the benefits and pay the regular tax rate just like anyone else; thus they’re just claiming the money they paid, which is fairly low due to their low income anyways.

Medical ethics requires doctors or pharmacautical companies to conduct their experiments with the informed consent from patients or volunteers, which means that an individual should be fully informed about the potential harms or benefits an experiments would like to bring. We think there's no point that such a basic moral principle could be tramped, this should be applied equally to both general public and prisoners, for the latter group although being deprived of their freedom or life, there's no justification why they also deprived the right to manage their own body.

A much better way is to treat the prisoners as responsible decision makers with their basic rights, who could realize their crime or \"debt\" as the prop states, and voluntarily choose to take part in the experiment, rather than to force them to participate no matter what. The thing here is not that since they will not be released back to society so don't bother to care about them, but that even in prison these death-row convicts as well as other prisoners will have an opportunity to be reformed with respect of equal basic rights and realize what they still can do for the greater good--and that's a real powerful or functioning justice system should aime for.

They will simply go into hiding and avoid being out in public or places that would expose them to police officers. This will firstly make the policy virtually ineffective as police officers still don't (and will never get) the ability to march into peoples' homes and demand immigration papers, but also forces greater ghettoisation as the immigrants will have greater incentive to form their own societies away from police. This will also have an effect on the people who employ illegal immigrants, as they do not want to lose the cheap labour. They will further want to hide their employees to stop them being caught and to stop themselves from facing prosecution. This will create a poorer relationships between these businesses and the police. Finally, the immigrants will not want to use services such as the police to help them with criminal issues.

{"id": 3838, "content": "UNHRC has a unique political system which in itself promotes HR. It separates the world into 5 different areas, and rotates the countries in each area, so that each country receives a 3-year representation period. Therefore, even if there’s a state of bloc voting, it would be only temporary since the rotation enables a blocked issue to re-surface later when other countries are joining the council. Moreover, countries will be less inclined to cooperate in bloc voting if they know that the other party, whom they are asked to protect, will soon rotate and not be able to reciprocate. Rotation means countries understand they can’t rely on theirs or allies' seat for protection, but mainly on reducing their abuse of HR. Basically, the rotating system encourages a race to the bottom: every country wants to be the least plausible and obvious target to the UNHRC censoring amongst non-member states, and so are pushed to reduce their HR abuse. Even if they do it just to avoid censoring or be a less obvious target, then the rotation system has already achieved its goals of reducing HR abuse. Moreover, we believe rotating seats allows more countries to be involved in condemning and guarding against HR abuse, as more countries are exposed to the subject over time. Countries which violate HR will not be elected to the council, a condemnation in itself, Belarus is a recent example. Once a country is on Council, it focuses its own attention on HR, and gains a greater understanding of the global harms of HR abuse - which leads to greater internal care of HR. While perhaps not ideal in its current form, we need to remember that UNHRC is a fairly young body that still shapes itself, after having been equipped with the right tools for the task."}

Throwing money at the problem can’t ensure that the money will be used to solve it, or that it will be used well. When it comes to giving money, as opposed to services, this is what happens. Gov gives people money without enough supervision and follow up. And so, because it can’t address the minute details, the problems are perpetuated, not solved. If not, then what the gov is doing is simply taking money as taxes from everyone, and giving it away to others. The gov should only take money in order to provide needed services - otherwise it should leave it to every person’s decision how to spend their money.

If the money doesn’t serve a critical need, then one usage of it isn’t better than the other - in both cases, the money goes towards non-essential needs It’s the gov’s duty to enable the objective conditions needed to live in a humane manner through services which verify that the needed conditions are met. Subjective conditions are set by society, and so it is society duty’s to enable them. Money, which is free to use by the owner’s discretion, enables those subjective conditions, and so should be given to the poor by the society, since society has decided on the need and will be able to spread it better. Bottom line, as long as the citizens’ basic rights are enabled, then any additional financial expenditure should be done by society, who'll do it better."}

If they don’t show results, or if the donors feel that their money is misused, they’ll lose donors, just as if volunteers feel that their efforts are wasted, they’ll leave for a better charity. Also, by law they are more transparent then byzantine govt programs, and must be so to keep the donors happy, and acquire new ones. Many Charities work directly with and in the community - charities can better understand what each community needs, and how to best supply it. Agenda - A critical point is that charities don’t have conflicts of interests with other “more important” causes. They’re specific and goal-oriented. All of these things lead to three very important results: a. Only the truly needy receive charity. The less regulations & overhead there is, the more effort can be made towards finding the people who need help, and the specific ways to help them. The charity they receive is what they need - poor students get grants, and the disabled get cheap wheelchairs but no-one gets just money thrown at their problems. c.

Through govt the poor reflect their demand & exert their power. Charities reflect the rich’s will. Govt’s abandonment of the poor is dereliction of the duty; charities’, deception offense. Giving sole responsibility to the charities leaves the poor in unpredictable will of the richer, utterly out of their own will voiced by govt. Prop argues as if govt is an obstacle to society; history shows govt adpted duty by public demand. When labor conditions presented enormity, fundamental reform was made by govt regulating trusts & courts ruling in favor of labor unions. People CHOSE to bring progressive era, expansion of bureaucracy & executive branch during New Deal because they wanted govt to do the job it was elected for. Where were the charities in all those crises? This is exactly why govt must bear macro-responsibility. People vote for govt in return for its service. Recognition of govt responsibility to the poor represents public acceptance of poverty as a societal problem & the poor’s power. Without that social pressure, the rich don’t have motive for huge donation other than occasional condescending penny toss for self-satisfaction. Human greed is insatiable, as it was for the rich before govt pressured them in the progressive era. Charities can work in the local level BECAUSE govt is behind them. Govt may serve ITS duty by MANDATING local tasks partially to the charities; but govt bears the ultimate responsibility & fulfills it by granting privileges to charities, monitoring charities’ success & adjusting financial support accordingly.

But since the introduction of Intel-based Macs, Mac users can now run Windows side-by-side with OS X on a Mac and take advantage of both the operating systems, together with the powerful hardware features of the Mac. Dual-booting is made excessively simple through Boot Camp, and virtualisation is easier in Mac's Parallels Desktop than with programs available for Linux. As someone who has tried to grapple with WINE, I can speak from experience. This makes the Mac the only platform which can enable you to run Mac OS X, Windows and Linux distributions on the same computer! Gamers can now run all their games on a Mac after installing windows on it. High end Macs have powerful graphic processors that will satisfy even the fussiest of gamers. Alternatively, with a greater uptake of Macs, a wide variety of games are now available on the OS X platform. One of the many reasons that game developers are flocking to consoles is due to the unpredictability of the hardware on PCs. It becomes harder to design a game when you must support an endless variety of video cards and processors. Macs are easier to develop games for due to the fact that the hardware environment is better controlled, much like consoles.

{"id": 3859, "content": "Abortion is no simple matter, and it involves mature considerations of all options available. The Opposition believes that most minors are simply not mature enough to make decisions that are in their best interest. This is especially because they are more vulnerable to impulses and sensitive to the slightest pressures. While we acknowledge that teenage girls might be afraid of informing their parents of their wish to obtain an abortion, or of their pregnancy at all, we also believe that for most pregnant teens, parents play a vital role in making decisions that are in their best interest. The most important decision-making centres of the brain are simply not fully developed in teens. This may help to explain certain teenage behavior that adults can find mystifying, such as poor decision-making, recklessness, and emotional outbursts.” Because their children are not intellectually developed, it is only reasonable to enact laws that protect teens and offer them the best chance possible to make a decision that is in their best interests. Teens facing pregnancy are understandably afraid and often embarrassed. Without the laws in place to ensure that they reach out, they may opt to keep it secret from their parents, depriving themselves of the very support they need."}
{"id": 3860, "content": "Societies around the globe recognize parents as having certain responsibilities. If a teenage driver gets into a car accident, it is the parents that are responsible for paying for the damage. The law in this case recognizes that the child should not be responsible. The decision to have an abortion is a serious one, as the Proposition has already agreed. Parents have a role in society to protect their children from dangers and things that may harm them. If we as a global society require parents to take responsibility, we need to ensure that they have a corresponding right to the information that will allow them to act. Having an abortion is a surgical procedure. If a child were having his tonsils out, the hospital would require a signed form from the parents giving them permission to perform the surgery. An abortion is no different. There are always risks with medical procedures and parents have a right to know what is happening with their child. The decision whether or not to terminate the pregnancy does not only affect the mother. If she decides not to keep the baby, whether it is through abortion or adoption, the emotional ramifications of that decision will affect the parents as the teen experiences them. If the teen decides to keep the child, the parents are affected in more ways than one. They will likely be the ones that are responsible for supporting the baby financially as most teenage mothers are unemployed. They will also be responsible for the care of the child during school hours while the teen is attending classes. The majority of society expects no less of them. The decision to allow a teen to obtain an abortion affects the parents as much as it does the teen, and therefore they should have the right to be a part of that decision."}

Researchers concluded that “exposure to abortion is a traumatic life event which increases longer-term susceptibility to common mental disorders”. Informing parents in order to obtain consent is essential and must be reinforced by law. Learning of an unplanned pregnancy is an emotional time. Teens are scared, ashamed and worried about disappointing their parents. It is at this time that they need the support of their parents the most. Having a law requiring that they tell their parents will help them to gain the support they might not ask for, but so desperately need. Parents offer an important connection and have a unique understanding of their own children. This is because they live under the same roof, eat at the same table, and have invested mentally, emotionally, and materially in their offspring. For this reason, they are able to most effectively offer counsel regarding the issue of abortion."}

At this point, the decision has most often been finalized, and the teen may feel committed to the procedure. Abortion, being a more immediate option than either adoption or caring for a child, often seems like a way to just make the problem of an unwanted pregnancy “go away” – particularly in the case of a teen whose brain is hard-wired to deal with emotions rather than facts. The Prop states that teens with understanding families do consult them over a pregnancy. We maintain that many of them are not. Many teens have no idea how their parents will respond to such a scenario, and unable to think rationally about the possibilities. The big problem is not parents who are against abortion, but teens who refuse to consult even supportive parents because they fear disappointing them. This is why they need to be pushed to consult their parents. We concede that there exists a problem with parents who fail to concern themselves with their children's well-being, however, these compose only a minority, and exceptions can easily be accommodated by the law. In fact, there are plenty of conservative folks who do begin to see things in a different light when it touches them. The problem here is that children, faced with pregnancy, are likely to withdraw rather than reach out and access parental support. In cases where conservative parents who genuinely care about their children do veto abortion, this is not as detrimental, nor is it likely to be as widespread, as children who have abortions without parental counsel and supp"}
{"id": 3863, "content": "We wholeheartedly reject the Prop’s suggestion that legal abortions are safe and present a teen’s best option, and that the danger for pregnant minors is parental intervention. Admittedly, parents in our world aren’t always what we wish them to be, but we insist that they do more harm than good. The Prop has denied the immense risks associated with abortion, which stretch from acute hematometra (post-abortal syndrome) to breast cancer, infertility, and increased risk for clinical depression and suicide. The suicide rate is nearly six times greater among aborting women than among women who give birth. These findings refute the oft-heard claim that induced abortion is safer than childbirth.” The myth that childbirth is more risky than abortion is largely based on the way that statistics about abortion-related deaths are collected: such deaths are often attributed to present problems. These are risks that parents have a right and a responsibility to evaluate for their minor children, who are by law as well as by custom the responsibility of parents. So why should abortions need consent when a decision to keep the child doesn’t? Quite simply, the nature of pregnancy in most cases necessitates parental involvement, since it is rarely kept a secret, and almost always requires emotional and material support. The law need not step in where immediacy does. In truth, each of the options, including abortion, carry with them serious and long-term risks that need to be not only carefully considered, but offset with the kind of support a parent is best able to give."}
{"id": 3864, "content": "The decision whether to have an abortion or continue the pregnancy often has a major long-term impact on a woman's psychological and emotional well-being, her ability to continue formal education, and her future financial status.

If parents are not informed, there is a risk that they and their daughters will become permanently estranged at a time when parental support is most important."}
{"id": 3865, "content": "Throughout this debate, the Proposition has argued that parental consent should not be necessary to obtain an abortion as teens are capable of making an informed decision. They have also argued that pregnancy is mentally and physically challenging, and teen mothers are a burden on society. When a teenage girl discovers she is pregnant, the immediate reaction is feelings of fear, humiliation and shame. She wants to fix the problem created by her impulsive act and avoid any distressing consequences. Some minors may not want to discuss their pregnancy with their parents, not because parents are unreasonable, but that the teen is afraid of disappointing them. They may not realize that parents are there to support them and will ultimately do what is in their best interest. The simple fact is that teens are better off if they have to consult their parents when making a life-altering decision. The reason many teens do not ask for help from their parents is not because they are able to correctly or rationally weigh the merits of all the available options, but because they are young, scared and emotional. No option is a universal remedy; all have significant drawbacks. The key, then, is to ensure that teens have sufficient support to deal with the decision that is made. Where parents are unable to give this support, then a judge’s evaluation of the situation is a safer bet than that of a panicking teenager. We believe that Prop's plan does little to resolve the problems in the status quo, but instead blurs the ultimate goal: the well-being of teen girls. This round comes down to a debate of not whether abortion is bad or not, but whether or not parental consent is beneficial for the minors themselves. There is no easy answers for teenage pregnancy, every solution will ultimately affect the teen and alter their lives completely. At the end of this debate we want to make sure that whatever decision was to be made- whether it was abortion or adoption - the minors are safe and supported. This will be achieved through parental support and guidance. Parents have a responsibility placed upon them society to take care for their children. If we pass this resolution, we will be taking away the tools for parents to be able to fulfill this responsibility. In order to guarantee that this takes place, the government must step in and make it mandatory that parents be involved in such a monumental decision. Abortion, like raising child is a huge responsibility. It is important to remember that we can never separate freedom from responsibility, and that when we offer minors the freedom to choose, knowing that the vast majority of them do not have tools to make a choice that takes their long-term interests into consideration, let alone the information or life experience to know what the risks are, we are placing a huge burden of responsibility on them that they are not equipped to handle. That is not being kind – it is irresponsible and unfair."}

Because land is fixed in place it can not leave the country to base itself in a low-tax nation the way money and people can. Because the tax is paid out of Rental income rather than Capital or Labor income (I use these 3 terms as Adam Smith did) it does not discourage work or investment (the \"Laffer curve\" issue). Land tax also has firmer ethical foundations than income tax, eg: Land rents can only be collected by individuals because the state records and enforces land titles. Land values go up with population growth and government expenditure on infrastructure such as roads, not anything to do with the efforts of the landlord (which are capital improvements, not extra Land). Ownership of goods is founded on the idea that a thing belongs initially to its maker and may then be traded freely, but Land was not made by anyone.

{"id": 3868, "content": "The tax that the proposition seeks to impose on meat products would adversely affect consumers of meat on lower incomes. This is because the increase in price the tax would add to meat products represents a larger proportion of the income of a lower-income consumer than one on a higher income. This means that the opportunity cost of buying meat for a lower income consumer increases at a higher rate than the higher income consumer when the tax raises prices. The opposition may argue that surely if governments do not find the inequality which arises from excise duties on alcohol and cigarettes a large enough issue to avoid this form of taxation, then surely the same can be said for meat. However, the difference with meat is that, as we on the opposition shall be discussing, there are methods of reducing the negative effects meat consumption on our planet, without simultaneously generating an additional harm, one of greater social inequality. In the cases of alcohol and cigarettes, this greater social inequality is perceived as justified. This is because the products themselves are viewed as harmful not only to the consumers themselves but can lead to harms to those other than the consumer, through the consumer's own direct practices. It is not the direct effect of the consumption of the meat product itself that we would wish to be reduced (ignoring the fact that yes, excessive amounts of any food is bad for your health), for no one fears anti-social behaviour in one with a penchant for meat as they do an alcohol abuser, but the indirect harms such as the soil erosion effects to land which is used for livestock farming. For many, meat is a necessity in terms of a balanced diet, unless we are to expect a total upheaval of consumption patterns right away. Therefore, we can see that the problem lies mainly in the practices exercised on the side of supply, rather than in the demand itself, and so approaching the situation from an angle which wishes to influence demand is not the most efficient."}

It is here that gossip is useful; where two people may have entirely different political views, ambitions, and backgrounds, it is, however, likely that both will have an opinion on a celebrity. Even the newest of acquaintances would be able to discuss, for instance, the Richie-Madonna divorce. Moreover, on a more personal ‘local’ level, it is also important in learning who not to trust."}

Your parents might put you in after-school care from 3pm-5pm, until they can pick you up. After-school care, in my case, is $50 per hour. Are parents willing to pay this price? If we extend school hours to 5pm, they won't have to put you in after-school care saving about $500 per week. Also, adults could work for longer and pick you up at about quarter-past 5-5:30, as you are allowed to stay after school is over for an amount of time.

Genetic modification is not yet well understood. Simple changes in one area of a chromosome can have unintended consequences later on. Genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, were created starting in the 1970’s to enhance agricultural production. Decades later, GMOs have experienced a reversal in popularity, with opponents citing issues with environmental impact, economic manipulation, and some evidence of an adverse effect on human metabolism. Since genetic alterations are permanent, there may never be a way to determine the long term safety of such modifications in the human population, nor any recourse to correct unforeseen consequences."}

It is well known that the road to Hell is often paved good intentions, and the omnipotent power wielded by genetic control could lead us well beyond medicine and into the realm of Eugenics.

In scene 7 of Act I, Macbeth in a soliloquy mentions that Duncan has been gracious and a kind king and that he has no reason to murder Duncan except for his 'over riding ambition'. At this point, Macbeth has decided that he shall not commit the murder. When he informs his wife of his decision, she pokes at his manliness and concludes that he is not worthy of being called a man. Questions raised on his character deeply hurt his ego. After Macbeth hears the plan that she has devised for committing the horrendous deed, he is immensely pleased with her and cannot find any loophole in the plan.

Trying to stop a shortage by depleting resources quicker seems to be one of the worst policies that could be implimented. Sometimes decisions have to be taken for the good of all of us and not just the few who want some more money. Getting off our addiction to oil sooner, while there is still plentiful supply as a potential fall back, is a wise move, and using funding which would otherwise go to offshore drilling will speed development of renewables. Oil companys themselves see the future outside oil, and its time the opposition did too. Therefore, while we acknowledge current dependence on oil, we feel this shouldn't simply be accepted but actively discouraged, and a ban on offshore drilling would be one such way to wean ourselves off of oil."}

Furthermore, strictly regulated offshore drilling that could be implemented in highly developed countries will produce less greenhouse gases compared to onshore drilling facilities in LEDCs from which major oil consumers buy their oil.

Oil is essential not only as a fuel but also for plastics, creams and many other goods tat are produced by it and so the great daily consumption tat it has has risked its existence, with some calculus estimating that in 10 years the supply will not be able to meet the demand and from there the reserves will drop dramatically, creating a chaos in human civilization. Antartica could be the solution for that. The Artic is estimated to have13% of the World's oil reserves (not contemplating Antartica) and we take advantage of that, and while the Antartic is even greater and could be the world's greatest resources reserve, but humanity is turning a blind eye on such a great and rich piece of land that as we said, should be a heritage for all of humankind. Let's also take the example of drinking water. Millions of people have died in the lat years because of problems related to droughts and with environmental problems increasing, the situation will be worse soon, while the majority of drinking water reserves are actually found on the ice and believe me, Antartica has lots of it. While we could save lives, we are not doing it for a childish whim of leaving Antartica untouched, just for the sake of it. That is not only inhumane but also stupid. We could also mention minerals that are very scarce (as rare sands) but could be found here.

It will be very regulated and only those enterprises that win the calls for bids on different resource extractions will be given permission to exploit them (in the same way that none is given permission now and this has been respected). If they break the law they won't be given permission to go on, just as when any state allows foreign companies to extract their resources under guidelines or else they are expelled. I mean, it's not as if companies couldn't be coerced by the whole world, its market. If it were the powerful states that wanted to abuse of the system it would be useless since certainly it will be their companies that will win the calls for bids so they will actually be economically benefited, providing them with that needed soft power. We don't say Tonga needs to compete with its non-existing oil extracting companies but rather that they will be able to acquire the resources depending on their needs plus since the majority of the earnings would go to the whole international community, they will be divided and Tonga will get its share without the need of extracting resources so it benefits every country in the end and at the same time taking care of the environment. On fishing, actually Opp mentions it as an activity they would ban (introduction) but when they noticed we argued good on the current fishing industry they said it's a different case because fishing is renewable, so we don't get it. The truth is that no fish has gone extinct at all as they claim, and the Patagonian toothfish poses a concern for its illegal fishing, not the legal one, which as we mentioned is closely monitored by the EMP to control their level, and it must go on.

Large-scale artificial changes on the continent’s vast tracts of glaciers could cause damage to the world’s environmental systems and the natural records of our world’s history. Antarctica is an ecological wonder with immense diversity that encompasses various endangered species and ancient species that help revealing the mystery of evolution. Furthermore, Antarctica has a unique natural cycle that acts the world’s environmental regulator. Seasonal changes in the icy continent cause ice shelves to melt and freeze regularly, creating a pattern of cold, fresh water released into the world’s oceans. Resource exploitation will accelerate unnatural melting that cannot be offset. Effects on ocean currents and temperature will be fatal even by the extent of current knowledge. The entire marine ecosystem will be jeopardized; resultant changes in climate will beget disasters bigger than ever before. The worst part is recovery, since less ice will remain as the buffer. We should also note that Antarctica holds an immense amount of historical climatic and evolutionary data. Not only are fossils in play here but also is accumulated ice—the vivid testimony to the climatic changes. While the proposition may again naively claim regulations will be sufficient, the fierce competition will undoubtedly devastate the ecology of Antarctica. Note that the proposition is not only talking about “collateral” damages but frontal destruction: the artificial extraction of fresh water is exactly what we should be afraid of.

We as a species have developed some obsense methdos of slughter and production to feed our gluttony, it is not moral to keep a pig in a cage simply because we want to consume its flesh, however this does not mean we should not eat meat. We should not activly practose cruelty to animals, we should treat them as living things that do require protection, but we should also treat them as a food source, not a food source to be exploited and mass farmed like we currently use them but a food source to be hunted to satisfy hunger and nutritianal needs. Lets look back to early civilization where most of a person;s diet would consist of grains and vegetables. A small villiage would practise farming of grains to make breads and vegetables, this was most of their diet. They would use cattle to pull plows and occasionally tehy would kill the cattle and eat it. This was how life was.

For that matter, there are many societal issues people on many sides could challenge from a \"moral\" standpoint. When we are debating about whether people should eat meat strictly from a nutritional viewpoint, vegetarians fall apart in their arguments, as you will read in the other points discussed from a nutritional standpoint. The problem is not with meat per se. The problem expressed by many who say \"don't eat meat\" is with how animals are raised, how they are fed, and how they are slaughtered. However, passing a law that says you cannot eat meat is short-sighted.. In a free society, we are free to buy or not buy products that we have an issue with, without imposing our morals and choices on others. If you don't like how a particular corporation or farmer raises, feeds and slaughters the animals, then don't buy their meat. Or, go through the proper legal channels to get regulations passed to change their practices. Don't just legislate that people can't eat meat anymore. That is a personal diet, as well as moral, choice. Personally, practicing \"fair chase\" and obeying the laws when hunting and making sure an animal is killed quickly and humanely is how we come by our venison, which we choose to eat over beef because we know the animal has lived and eaten natural foods. Another choice could be to buy from organically operated farms which raise animals in an environment as close to natural as possible, with the animals being able to roam freely in clean areas with natural foods to eat."}

This suggest animals such as mice can create new representations of the world in novel combinations, binding together different sensory modalities in the same way that consciousness binds together our experiences. Animals can feel pain, and feel emotion in response to that pain that affects their ability to learn in much the same way as in humans. The life of a farmed animal is filled with pain. This may include being branded with scolding iron, castration and being de-horned all without pain relief. Many factory farmed animals will be forced to live in cramped and dirty conditions without the opportunity for much exercise or environment enrichment. In the dairy industry after giving birth, calves will be forcibly removed from their mother. After a short life of being made pregnant, having their calves forcibly removed and being milked at a high intensity many dairy cows can get mastitis(a very painful udder infection) and have reduced milk production and are then killed. Some of those male calves are then used for veal. Those cows used for beef are transported in poor cramped condition's in lorries to the slaughter house. The capacitive bolt is not a humane method of inducing permanent unconsciousness before killing, the prevalence of a shallow depth of concussion after being hit with the bolt in one study was 7.7% for all cattle, and 15.1% for young bulls. These animals are psychologically damaged by these experiences. One animal model of depression in rodents is enforced separation of pups from the mother. These animals show a reduced performance in a forced swim test, ie they stop trying to tread water and escape from a tank of water and instead enter a state of despair. Another way of inducing depression in animals is the chronic mild stress model that involves the exposure of animals to a series of mild and unpredictable stressors and results in long lasting changes of behavioural and neurological function that can be reversed with antidepressants, just like in humans. If one values psychological well being of sentient animals then one must also oppose the eating of meat."}
{"id": 3994, "content": "The trade union will push the employer for as many concessions as possible while the employer tries to employ its workers for as low as possible, this relationship usually results in equilibrium. The two side’s weapons are threat of retrenchment from the employer & threat of quitting from the employees. Striking upsets this balance because employers cannot realistically fire all their employees because of high turnover costs. This leads to trade unions gaining more concessions as employers don’t have any recourse. The risk of this happening is high because of the political nature of trade unions. Due to the immense benefits that union reps get, there is an incentive for people to run for & retain their position as union rep. In order for them to get re-elected, they compete to cater to the demands of the workers. Workers are constantly pushing their union reps to demand more from the employers. They do not consider the ability of the employer to pay higher wages because they are looking out solely for the worker which leads to the employer being abused. In such cases with vital industries such as transport, the harms are considerably high. Before going into the harms, we need to remember that this is a comparison between gaining worker’s rights through legal arbitration, versus through strikes. This is because every government knows that without mobility for its citizens, productivity is impaired. The govt uses tax-payer money to fund the transportation industry because it recognizes mobility as a fundamental right of the people, so to take away this right, even for a few days, one needs to have strong justification."}

Many times the strikes happen because workers are demanding things that will make their work environment a safer one and since the environment is shared with the users the benefits affect them too. An example of such a strike happened in Belgium , where a trail accident caused workers to go on a strike that wasn't even sponsored by their Union. A strike can be a call for police supervision at nights to stop crime, more mandated sleep hours between shifts, maintenance on the vehicle breaks , etc) that benefit both groups. Everything from ergonomics to traffic can make the work of a bus driver high risk . Bettering working conditions in general prevents absenteeism, reduce stress in workers which in turn benefits the users. The short term harm of a strike pales in comparison to the improvement in service and safety felt by all. Also, outlawing unions/workers/people ability to bargain better conditions is a counterproductive way to achieve public well-being since society's collective bargaining is also affected. It's clear that transport workers are members of society and should be protected as such but if the government is allowed to ban strikes for that industry; there is nothing to stop it from doing the same to health workers or food industry workers, for instance."}
{"id": 3996, "content": "Polygamy can cause serious psychological harms to one part of the marriage and the children. Marriage is an institution having raising children as one of the main goals. An ideal background for growing up means two parents – a mother and a father equally representing the two sexes. Growing up in a polygamous family may have disadvantages such as: a) Understanding that one sex is superior to the other when it is not represented in equal number in the marriage. b) Authorities confusion – Who should the children listen to particularly? Is the other “mum”´s word as important as the real mother´s? This might also lead to worsening of the relationship between the adults caused by envy that one partner is loved more by the children than the other or the discreditation of their authority which leads to great feeling of inferiority and frustration. Women in polygyny marriage usually do not have the say whether the man marries another woman. Being one of many spouses makes them feel inferior next to the single opposite-sex spouse who represents „the king of the household“ and the superior same-sex spouse. Long-term frustration coupled with feeling of own inferiority can result in suicides or mental disorders. The mental health of women from polygamous marriages are much worse than of those from monogamy couples and they have notably lower self-esteem and life satisfaction. More importantly we need to take into consideration the children who can not choose their family – the mental health of the parents have a bad impact on children as the development is strictly determined by the family atmosphere. Therefore polygamous marriage should not be recognized in order to prevent such harms."}

Men are not as heavily represented in lyrical content, nor have they been suffering from abuse & violence as severely as women over history. As such we find the portrayal of women in music & music videos to be a major problem that must be actioned immediately in order to stop the continuing cycle of abuse against women across the globe. If music explicitly expresses a message of debasement, hatred, or violence without just cause, then what is the real benefit to society- and in particular women- of producing & distributing such content? There is a clear moral imperative to not accept the current status quo, as women shouldn't be forced to tolerate or condone music which debases their character or dignity. Team Australia proposes a model system in which current government censorship bodies in any given nation would simply censor or ban any music which contain lyrics any reasonable person would deem to recount/encourage violence against women. This would be based the consideration of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Through education & explicit action each country would be expected to consider this protocol seriously & act; therefore not behaving as the ‘Nanny’ of the country but as a powerful implementer of policy that truly is effective in the long term, reducing the market and appeal of such music and the video spin-offs that potentially cement these poor depictions of behaviour towards women; behaviour that without change will continue to be the norm."}

For this reason we find that an automatic triggering of a general election would not always be in the best interests of the nation and it's people.

We propose that in most cases, such as the one mentioned by the proposition - death of a PM - or in the case of change dictated by the best interests of the nation, there would be no benefit to the wider community of calling an immediate re-election and stopping progress on all current governmental schemes and policies simply because a change has been made within the party heirachy.

Individual PMs are not granted any real extra power over other cabinet ministers, but rather have the role of upholding an image for their party amongst the public and the media, appoint cabinet members and make decisions with the other cabinet members. The media is utilised by the party to sell their policies, and those running for PM create a façade which is used to sway the voter’s opinion and convince them that their party has the best policies. The Prime Minister-ship of Tony Blair and his relationship with Gordon Brown is one such example of this, after the death of Labor Minister, John Smith, Blair and Brown made a pact to allow Tony Blair to run for leadership.

When we look at the issue of instability, we can see that a change in Prime Minister does not in fact disturb the running of the government in charge however, instability will arise by triggering an automatic general election which may bring upon sudden and uncertain changes creating further economic instability in countries which may or may not be able to afford to risk instability. The automatic triggering of a general election is an unnecessary upheaval and use of resources as it provides no real benefit to the best interest of the nation’s people."}

{"id": 4004, "content": "Property rights are of critical importance in society. Losing the ability to make copies of media prevents people from backing up digital files, putting them at risk of loss. It also decreases the value of such materials; this may seem like a trivial point in the case of a CD, but one must realize that one's property is not just a store of wealth and utility, but also an expression of all the efforts and decisions necessary to obtain it. When a possession is lost or rendered valueless, the time and effort put into obtaining the possession is rendered meaningless, effectively negating the personal value of previous actions. This value is why property rights are foundational to society, even in situations where the property has little economic value; property has value as the tangible result of personal autonomy. Protections that fail to stop piracy also further depress demand for copyrighted products. This is because individuals feel strongly over what they feel is theirs; about their property rights. They spend hours making money representative of hard work and more time figuring out how to spend said money. They want something that is theirs and with the limitations stated above people are less inclined to buy. This is especially true with free files on torrents and sites like Limewire. If offered a choice between an unrestricted free service and a restricted pay one, many will choose the former. The lack of respect for property rights makes products less appealing. What then follows is that if obtaining pirated files has gotten easier then people who buy protected files are already respecting copyrights against immediate self-interest. If that's the case they are less likely to to try and break copyright laws. The technologies are restricting the property rights of the wrong people, people unlikely to break the law. Thus the technology is also inefficient. More importantly it is restricting rights without offering the protection a social contract should."}

Yet the equivalent has happened in the...pension system with barely a ripple of dissent. Having 8 executives in change of pensions in 10 years is a recipe for bad management. As Nicolas Moreau explains: \"Without stability, there can be no concerted effort for change and, consequently, rather than making serious inroads into addressing the pensions problem, we...continue to spin plates.\". This structural inadequacy can be explained with reference to political shortsightedness. Pension funds as an enterprise require long-term planning to prevent crises. Politicians, however, are structurally inclined to favour short-term benefits. Pensions display a strong inflation-bias. When a politician is faced with a choice of reducing pensions to prevent a crisis in 10 years or increasing pensions to win an election that year they will choose the latter. While reducing pensions can be necessary to preserve the pension system in the long-term, acting thus incurs severe electoral penalties which politicians, who won't be around in the long-run, do not want to take on. Pensions are a thankless business which requires objective, long-term evaluations which governments cannot offer."}

They willingly assume responsibility for the success or failure of a venture and are answerable for all its facets. Private Enterprise can cope with the need for long-term planning. The interplay between the different managers and stockholders works to instill a strong sense of self-preservation in such enterprises. Private enterprises, when regulated properly, work to ensure their own long-term survival. Unlike the government, their survival is (a) not guaranteed and (b) dependent on efficient running of the business practice. They are forced to make attractive yet sustainable proposals to consumers, who as responsible individuals are allowed to choose from a wide variety of schemes within a market framework that is liberated from government intervention but still supervised to ensure competition. Allowing for the flourishing of private enterprise aligns incentives with efficient, sustainable and long-term minded practices. The way government schemes function act creates a pension time-bomb. The system works by the current generation of workers providing the pensions for the previous generations. Given the aging population this creates a time bomb that most developed countries are facing. Chronic failures of this system coupled with public mismanagement leads to an unsustainable situation.. Private institutions gather contributions from workers which then form the basis for their pension which is more sustainable. Moreover, given proper regulation, private institutions will be adverse to excessive risk as consumers will choose to move to other providers. Private corporations are better suited in the long-run than the government allowing for sustainability."}
{"id": 4007, "content": "In liberal states the role of the government is to provide a framework where private individuals and corporations can use the market mechanism to allocate resources and jobs as and when needed. It is not the business of liberals government to provide employment for everyone. One's pension is essentially an extension of one's income into retirement. The government needs to provide a framework where private providers can provide pensions which individuals are free to choose from. Rather than \"crowd-out\" different options the government should help foster competition and the associated variety of retirement schemes to allow individuals to make choices about their own retirements. The present system imposes taxes in support of a system whose inefficiencies mean that pensioners get less for their money than they would under a developed private system. Indeed, the dominant blanket policy pushes many pensioners below the poverty line. Moving on from the last point one can also deduce that apart from harming individual pensioners this inflexible, inflation-prone system of state pensions results in a fiscal-burden that is detrimental to the legitimate role of government. The massive fiscal burden that governments take on prevents it from focusing its attention where it is really needed, providing benefits to those below the poverty line, reducing taxes to attract business and regulating the markets. This as a whole is not conducive to the government's role in society."}
{"id": 4008, "content": "José Piñera A specter is haunting the world. It is the specter of bankrupt state-run pension systems. The pay-as-you-go pension system that has reigned supreme through most of this century has a fundamental flaw, one rooted in a false conception of how human beings behave: it destroys, at the individual level, the essential link between effort and reward--in other words, between personal responsibilities and personal rights. Whenever that happens on a massive scale and for a long period of time, the result is disaster. The impact of decreasing birth rates and improved medical care which has increased life expectancy is burning holes into public finances.. The fact of the matter is that in addition to the fact that government handling of pensions is inefficient, short-sighted and in many cases corrupt, the very model governments use, taking funds from one generation to give to the other, is not longer feasible. Private enterprises employ savings accounts. Workers are responsible for their pensions and are reliant only on themselves for it. This model allows for sustainability and is safer in the long-run than the time-bomb in public finances created by continuing public pensions."}

The N.P.V(net present value) of payments of financial fees to private companies in the case of privatizing securities will be a dramatic profit of $940 billion over 75 years. However, such funds can never benefit the ordinary citizens of the U.S and other market-based economies. For the sole reason that it is too risky. While and we have said this before; for economies that are largely bank-based the market and thus private pension funds play a rather unimportant insignificant role in terms of citizen welfare. As companies/schemes/funds rise and fall based on their relations with prominent banks and not on the ups and downs of markets; in a market economy once pension funds are privatized wall street benefits, the public is duped and most(if not all) of us are victimized by financial scams of the kind noted earlier. The market is unpredictable; we the citizens of these nations are not equipped with the financial expertise required to handle our own finances.

{"id": 4011, "content": "Historically, some athletes have decided to get an edge against their competition by utilizing illegal substances or have been negatively influences to do so by their social network, trainers, teammates or peer pressure. This goes against the maxim of what healthy competition represents. Council of Europe in the Code of Sports Ethics The potential benefits to society and to the individual from sport will only be maximised where fair play is centre stage. The truth is that whenever doping is discussed the debate is centered around why do athletes fall into the temptation that banned substances represent, but the main reasons why athletes do not cheat are rarely mentioned. Fact is that the main reason athletes choose not to cheat is the risk of being caught, so this leads to the argument that the risk of cheating has to be so big and the consequences so harsh that more athletes will choose to remain clean. Sociologist Howard S.Becker published a classic work in 1963 called Outsiders which illustrates that athletes' main reasons to avoid taking illegal substances hardly ever relate to moral standards or health issues, though they may factor in the decision. The reason for not doping back when the study was made that was given repeatedly was the fear that it would be socially excluding; that it would ruin the athlete's reputation if he or she were caught. The best way to illustrate how the larger risk represented through the removal of all medals to an Olympic Team will further deter the use of banned substances will be to analyze the situation from a trainer's point of view. In most cases, athletes are either recommended to use the substances by their trainers or at least the trainer is aware of the use of said substances. So, if a trainer knows than one of his athlete's does not stand a chance to win, he may support the use of banned substances. However, if that athlete's decision could hurt the entire team, he would prevent it from happening."}
{"id": 4012, "content": "We believe individual sanctions are not working. Sanctioning the whole team will substantially improve the status quo. Today, tests are done randomly or in cases of suspicion (i.e. when records are broken), so for athletes that choose to use prohibited substances the worst-case scenario is to get caught and bear the responsibility of their actions themselves. But if we increase the cost of getting caught by punishing their olympic team, the individual athletes who used to use these substances would have to face harsher consequences both for themselves and their team if he/she is caught. They will have to face condemmnation by the team, probably have fights with their teammates, and the fact that they ruined the team's performance will give them a huge burden to carry throughout their entire life and will negatively effect their reputation with the fans. For instance, if a soccer player during a match is tempted to commit a gross foul during the game, and he knows he could be expelled for such an action, maybe he would not mind doing so, if for him it is not a big deal to stop playing. But since expulsion means the team will play with 10 players instead of 11, he knows such an action would bring a negative effect for the whole team, so this pressures him into being more careful not to break the rules, because his actions could punish the whole team. Therefore, teammates will be angry at the individual who committed the gross foul and would blame him for the problems he created for the entire team. So, this policy creates peer pressure. Athletes working within a team, will want their teammates to behave properly and not to consume prohibited substances. If those who do not use drugs did not care in the past about whether or not their teammates used drugs or not because that was \"their own business\", will now be forced to care since they could be affected. So now everyone is pressing drug-users to stop consuming them, because now it is everyone's business."}
{"id": 4013, "content": "This debate is about whether the teammates hold the responsibility for one teammate’s wrongdoings. The whole team doesn’t win when one person does a good job; for the same reason, we believe the WHOLE team cannot lose because one person did something bad. Why should we punish people who have earned medals when one team member makes a bad decision that others didn’t or might’ve not known about? It was the athlete’s decision and s/he should be held responsible for his/her actions, not the teammates. Like we’ve mentioned in previous arguments, proposition had a fallacy in their argument that this motion would create social pressure as it was based on a heavy assumption that these teammates knew what was happening at all times. This assumption fails to apply to all of cases and also does not explain why the teammates deserve to be stripped of their medals if they were to deserve the medals as any other athletes who played accordingly to the regulations. Even if teammates knew, this wouldn’t necessarily cut down motivation for the athlete to stop dope usage because their motivation solely depends on winning, and they will instead try to hide the fact they are doping from their teammates which can actually increase negative health risks as prop is concerned about. Also, we have to consider the alternate athletes of the team. The motion does not deal with Olympic participants, but team members. We should be aware that a team is often made up of the number of people they require plus an alternate. An alternate athlete is given the opportunity to participate in a competition when the main athlete gets injured or sick; they may not play in the game but are still considered as a member of a team. Alternate athletes may not even participate in the game, but for the fact that they used dope, they have the potential to ruin their whole team’s career. With this in mind, it is evident that punishing the entire team is unjustifiable."}

This would open bully victims up as they would discuss bullying issues with teachers knowing that something definitive could be done. If a child thinks it's okay to hit because a teacher or adult uses corporal punishment then that child is slow and fails to realize the purpose and meaning behind such an action. Besides a good and effective teacher is not going to use corporal punishment all the time, but as a last resort when all else fails. A threat is no good unless there is some fearful truth behind it.

These values include public health - required immunizations not only have concrete benefits but also teach children that their actions have consequences on the greater whole. We believe that parents that teach their own children have less of incentive to immunize children and statistically do not. Public schooling gives a voice to the government that speaks of the societal values that have been agreed on by the general public. We believe that both society and the government have a right to influence the child's development, not only because the government plays a part in protecting the child, but because of the important role the future adult will play as a citizen of society. We believe that public schooling is the mouthpiece for the interests of both the government and society as a whole. Naturally, parents will have the right to influence the development of the child, but homeschooling allows parents to become sole dictators of the child's progress, which is harmful. While some parents' 'curriculum' may be aligned with that of the public, there are no safeguards against parents that may indoctrinate their kids with beliefs that will raise them to become harmful citizens. These beliefs can include gross intolerance for particular minority groups supported by false information. These ideas can still reach the child outside of school, but the government has a duty to protect children from a regressive upbringing by at least offering a more constructive perspective. The cost of not ensuring that the next generation has the foundation of accepted principals and values of the society in them outweighs the potential benefits of homeschooling."}

In the context of this debate, we believe that there are unique benefits to receiving an education outside of the home that are so conclusive and so vital that they make school an absolute necessity that every child should partake in. A crucial part of an education outside of the home is the interaction amongst the students that is used to prepare them to have constructive engagements with fellow citizens when their schooling is over. Interacting with other children who may be taught different belief systems and come from different social-economic statuses and religious or ethnic backgrounds prepare students for their future, where the potential of having to deal with someone who is different is almost inevitable. While there may be attempts by parents to socialize their children through other means (such as joining sports teams or youth clubs), these organizations are centered around similarity - all the kids that enjoy the same thing or believe in the same values congregate. School is a mixture that does not filter out students, and there is an inherent social value to such a mix. We believe that governments have a duty to ensure, or at the very at least, provide children the potential to interact with other children of different backgrounds at such a crucial time of their development as active and productive citizens. The only way to do this is to eliminate systems such as homeschooling that promote exclusivity under the guise of protection. The only way to truly hold the child's interests as a priority is to to prepare them for the society that they will soon inherit; homeschooling attempts to construct a world for the child that often does not match reality."}

It can be in the cases where the school is too far away and there is no possibility to go there, this is a big problem for example in New Zealand where The Correspondence School had originated in order to help parents educating their children at home. Hence, home schooling is the only possibility for parents to defend their disabled children, mainly in the earlier school years where is the possibility of bullying highest. Thus, ban on homeschooling would constitute an unusual and cruel burden on many families, and would actually deprive their children of proper education. That is not something that any society can stand for. Another group harmed by the standard education system are talented and gifted children. The public schools and teachers there usually don’t have time and opportunities to help them. They spend their time in school uselessly and can’t use their potential because teachers don’t have time to work with them. Homeschooling provides parents the chance to fully use the potential of their children and give them the most effective education because they can work with them on topics in which the children are good.

Many agree that complete lack of regulation is no longer desirable. Equally, however, excessive government regulation in any part of the economy could yet backfire. How can the best of both worlds - free marketeering and government regulation - be ensured? Through smart policies like ours. A benefit of our policy is that it is an illustration of how to get the mix between regulation and hands-off liberalism, correct. Our policy is based on the ideological conviction that the state has a political and ethical mandate to ensure that social disasters, like economic recessions, are either avoided, or that steps are taken to minimise the impact of recessions that do arise. Given that our mechanism, as already proven, is an effective tool for minimising the possibility, and certainly the impact, of a banking crisis - it is therefore a policy that exhibits responsible government. Yet, at the same time, the policy falls short of being unduly, and unacceptably, prescriptive. Banks are still left with a fundamental capacity to make autonomous economic decisions within the reasonable constraint imposed by our policy. Thus our policy is consistent with economic freedom, and the recognition of the importance of allowing economic agents, banks included, the space to play freely with each other - ensuring the textbook benefits of economic liberalism, but with a safety valve necessitated, ultimately, by our inherent human capacity to be self-destructively imprudent.

We have already pointed out the important historical and cultural value these symbols have. A new symbol won't be as powerful as these and won't have any association with the greatest moments in the history of humanity, thus the necessity to use a new symbol will demoralize people in these organizations. If they continue to display banned symbols, they will be punished by fines or put in prisons, which will undermine these organizations. It was already partially brought up that by using such symbols, these organizations could attract people that do not really share the same ideology with them, but join these organizations because of their willingness to look cool wearing a swastika or other symbolic reason they find in it.

As we all know there is no dealer who will tell his customers that by buying this product they threaten their health or that there are special programs which help people to stop using drugs. Nowadays all member states of the European Union sell all the tobacco products with labels which inform the consumers about the risks of smoking. Such an idea can be applied to drugs only if they are legal. The results of this initiative are obvious. This report shows that many people consider the effective, especially the people under 30, the age in which people are most susceptible to using drugs. Another point is that the country will offer free injections which will cost the country nothing compared with what it spends on coping with diseases such as AIDS. Imposing laws that bind the sellers to give a free unused needles will make drug consumers forget about using a needle twice.

{"id": 4070, "content": "Although in this debate we are solely focusing on the issue of liver transplant on the alcoholic patients, we also have to keep in mind of how the effectuation of this policy can impact other sectors of transplantation. Once this blame game is started on all patients for the supposedly \"explicit\" harms that they have brought on themselves, so many patients in dire need will be prone to denial of life. According to the logic of the Proposition, smoking and obseity, for example, could be identified as those harms that patients have been simply \"irresponsible\" with and lead to a denial of heart, lung, or kidney transplant. Meanwhile, once the need-based distribution system is kept, we do not have to waste any lives of the patients and also governmental effort on playing the blame game on questionable grounds."}
{"id": 4071, "content": "From the previous speech written by the Proposition, we on the opposition figures that they are having difficulties differentiating the status quo and what they are proposing. Already in the status quo, we do have guidelines that designates certain standards for a successful operation. And as we have stated before, in case of alcoholism, the patient has to remain abstinent for at least 6 months to be legible to a transplant. This is a basic requirement for the sake of successful surgery. On the other hand, what the Proposition has been proposing today is that the doctors will deny the transplants to all of those who have a record of alcohol abuse and thereby “brought the disease upon themselves” (as they would like to believe.) With that clear distinction in mind, we on the opposition sees that the Propositions point on how their policy is a just another part of criteria already taking in place is invalid. Also we would like to point out that in the status quo, liver transplants are not given to the alcoholic patients who have been drinking to excess in the past 6 months, because the doctors sees that it is a proven fact that liver transplants will not work on those patients who simply cannot refrain from drinking even when they are about to get a transplant. This is a given fact for sure. However, as we have mentioned again and again, the Proposition is assuming that “giving this man a new liver when he’s an alcohol addict ‘will probably’ relapse.” And from their statistics we see that 38% of the alcoholic patients may drink after the surgery while the other 62% does not. Even for those alcoholic patients who continue to drink after surgery, they do not drink to the point of critically stressing their liver because from what we figure they survive just as long as any other normal patient who has received the surgery. Now on an ethical note, the Proposition argues that the modern day Hippocratic Oath – in link with utilitarianism - can be used as an excuse for denying the rights to life on certain patients. We see that they would even like to use it as a societal institution that can do the moral calculus for the doctors. However, the reality is that making the final decision on whether or not the patient will be able to survive and how much the “blame” is to be placed on is fundamentally made by the doctors. It is a burden that they cannot simply be dismissed from. In light of that, we have to reminded of the fact that in this situation, doctors can never have the full assurance that an alcoholic patient who has not drank for the past 6 months will not be able to survive the surgery. Only the facts proving the contrary continue to surface. Thus under the ethical guidelines that binds all doctors, they are required to carry out the treatments in the best interest of the patients. In the end, it all comes down to the question of whether or not there is a chance these patients can survive. As the Proposition has partially agreed and we on the Opposition has continuously pointed out, it is becoming more and more apparent that these people do survive and live a healthy life ever after. And under that factor, we firmly believe that no doctor has the right to deny the patients’ privilege to life."}

The constant bickering over who gets what is a great emotional damage that can be countered by pre-nups. During a divorce process where a pre-nup is considered the parties get what they agreed on. Their tension and anger towards each other is minimized and they can go their separate ways in a more humane and civilized way. This is especially important to couples with children. Children suffer greatly during divorce procedures as they dehumanize former partners and turn them against each other. When relations spoil to that extent children get the greatest share of emotional trauma. We don't think that anybody should suffer to that extent and this is why people should be allowed to counter this sort of damage by entering into pre-nups. Lengthy divorce battles may not always produce fair outcomes. The person who is more prone stress, will at some point no doubt feel that s/he will do whatever only to end the nightmare of courts. This may entice him to give ground on certain matters, for example relinquish some of his property, only to reach a settlement faster.

As some legal frameworks necessitate sharing wealth 50/50, this could mean that assets will have to be sold, so that it’s worth can be divided equally. This will create a problem when some of those assets are inherited and have, therefore, sentimental value. This heightened sense of security will benefit both parties, as they can be much more confident with the marriage and not be suspicious of one another. \"Making a prenup may actually strengthen your relationship.

Marriage decreases legal ambiguity for individuals in a society, and lessens the burden upon the state to clarify ambiguities that result. Marriages are a mechanism to clarify next of kin, responsibilities toward children, the people who are impacted by a legal will upon the death of a spouse, and many other interactions that individuals have between themselves, each other, and the state.

Psychological Perspectives on Lesbian and Gay Male Experiences. Columbia University Press]] Much of the fervor against same-sex marriage relates to same-sex adoption.

An excellent example is that of homosexuals serving in the military; where it was thought that homosexuals would not make good soldiers, today they serve with distinction in dozens of militaries across the world. Without the prospect of legal marriage, society also reentrenches itself in negative stereotypes of LGBT people as hypersexual, not interested in anything social that is not sexual. Marriage allows a couple that is sexually committed to have a social category that encompasses more than their sexual intimacy. LGBT indivuals are denied this right, and are forced to categorize their de facto spouse as a mere \"partner\".

But, if we look at the democracies of today, we see an ever-increasing trend towards more and more checks to prevent the tyranny of the majority that the opposition supports. Presidential Vetos, Judiciaries, and Constitutions, all provide checks against the majority rule. Most countries' constitutions explicitly forbid legislation that unfairly privileges a majority group, as seen in the enshrinement of equal rights in these documents. Opposition argumentation seems to suggest that the government may only override the will of the majority in the most extreme circumstances (e.g. the slaughter of twins). A government may subvert the will of the majority when, if it did not act, demonstrable harms would result. We can see this happen throughout the history of human rights, be it anti-discrimination laws, affirmative action laws, hate crime laws, or any other. The insinuation that government legislation for same-sex marriage would be an unfair imposition on the majority of dissenters only stands once government starts forcing its citizens to marry someone of the same sex. To quote opposition: \"Liberalism is in essence the preference for self determination at the most personal level.\" This would seemingly make it clear than self determination at an individual level is the highest priority. Same sex marriage allows for self-determination within the LGBT community, without hindering the self-determination of those who oppose same sex marriage.

The principle that opposition defends is that the moral legitimacy of a legal system depends in part on taking seriously the moral preferences of its citizenry, hence our clash of moral and legal pluralism. Besides, the debate about evolution vs. creationism is disanalogous. Evidence in favour of evolution is an empirical matter, and the creationism claims, though partly principled, has to answer the empiricism of evoultion. The same-sex marriage debate is fundamentally a normative ethical one. It is not an 'empirical fact' that same-sex marriage is acceptable. Such an assumption, which seems to be the motivator for Team USA's 'rebuttal by ridicule', is circular.

They start off accepting that a plurality of moral views on homosexuality exist but then assert that homosexuality is acceptable. This assertion does not engage the pluralism they acknowledge, it simply by-passes it by fiat. Opposition is not arguing, as we had said before but which must have fallen on closed eyes, that homosexuality is immoral. We are agnostic on the issue because there is no moral objectivity that can settle the issue. Proposition has tried to make their case by framing it in terms of emotive human rights language. That is deceptive - clever, but worthy of the label deception. Of course there is a difference between what should be state-sanctioned, and what should be allowed to exist in private. Yes, in private, it is ok for someone to believe that twins should be killed but no state should sanction this view. In this kind of case, both teams would be happy, presumably, to endorse a disconnect between public policy and private belief. However, same-sex marriage, in the absence of more convinving normative analyses, does NOT constitute a matter on which moral truisms can be claimed by anyone. Just as it is extremely arrogant for some religious persons to claim that it is a moral 'fact' that homosexuality - and, so, same-sex marriage - is a moral sin, similarly, it is an exercise in arrogance by Team USA to implicitly assert that same-sex marriage is, as a matter of moral *obviousness*, acceptable, such that public policy must reflect this moral truism. Yes, related issues, such as the right to not be dismissed at work or ill-treated at work, on the basis of your orientation, constitute clear cases of human rights abuses. Same-sex marriage is not a human rights issue. In the case of abortion - which Team USA surely must accept as a good parallel for making sense of the relation between public mores and public policy, even if they do not like the twins example - we do not find it wrong that there is moral and legal pluralism in relation to the status of abortion rights. Yes, people passionately debate the issues around abortion, but REASONABLE MORAL AND LEGAL DISAGREEMENT is accepted as inevitable and ok. Remember, this debate is not place-set in a particular country. This is why opposition need not, and did not, take a view on homosexuality's acceptability - or that of same-sex marriage - in that country. Proposition's case is set up as a desire for all countries to enact same-sex marriage laws.

{"id": 4086, "content": "According to the Geneva convention the principle of proportionality states that harm caused to civilians or civilian property must be proportional and not excessive in relation to the direct military advantage anticipated in an attack on a military objective. Military objective is defined are defined to be those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage . When a state is in conflict with a non-state actor we think that a legitimate military objective is the capture (extraterriotorial if neccessary) of combatants of that non-state actor. In the case of terrorist networks individuals can bare a lot of power. There are terrorist ''king-pins'', who control and moralize other terrorists and are in possession of important information about the network. The capture of these individuals can be a blow to the terrorist organization, because it loses an experienced member who can train others and demoralizes the organization. Of course it also disarms this individual and limits his capacity to threaten the state further. With this we establish that there is a definite military advantage in the capture of such individuals. But is it proportional to the damage done to civilians? To justify the proportionality of extra-territorial rendition we have to look at what kind of damage it can bring to the civilian population of other states. The proposition has brought out that sometimes innocent individuals will be captured. Against this we argue that during the course of the trial the innocence or guilt of the captured individuals has to emerge. When it is established that the individual was indeed innocent the damage done to that person can be reversed by returning him to his home state. If however the individual is guilty, his capture would have potentially lead to the saving of lives of many civilians and thus is a proportional act. For proportional response to ever be applied, it is required that a country should have access to the entire spectrum of possible responses. Otherwise, it is impossible to select the response which matches the cause with the required severity. When options are taken from the table, what happens? Inevitably, a country will be left between two options, one which is less severe than that required, and one which is more severe. Even if we assume the country has mercy in its soul, and opts for the less response, the lack of proportionality will mean that it will not have fully served its purpose in cutting off the threat which provoked it, thereby making it less effective than the response that direct proportionality requires. Unfortunately, even this best case scenario is unlikely to happen. Countries are less sensitive to foreign deaths than those of their own citizens. Therefore, the path most chosen is likely to be that of greater than proportional vengeance, and therefore greater than proportional bloodshed. The importance of allowing small scale solutions to small scale problems is one widely recognised, at least implicitly, by modern nation states. Most nation states operate intelligence agencies, and many of these conduct operations overseas, often without the knowledge of local governments. And yet, the operations of these agents, who are the agents of a foreign state, and often involve the collection of sensitive information, or materials, is not, and is unlikely to ever be, considered a warcrime. The reason, is because without these small scale, surgical instruments at hand, states would have only far heavier tools for dismantling threats to their existence. In the case of extroardinary rendition. Certainly, there are some scenarios when a suspect would simply be left alone. But is it to be expected that any government would simply allow an individual who is plotting the murder of its citizens to continue unobstructed? Far more likely for goverrnments to take more drastic measures, from openly declared strikes and incursions, to placing economic, military, or political pressure on state leaders to permit the extradition and interrogation of their suspect. Both alternatives are far more damaging to long term political relations between the countries, and far less likely to be effective in stemming the short term problem. War crimes law should be designed to defuse conflict, not incite it."}
{"id": 4087, "content": "While a terrorist act is still being planned and resources and arms are being acquired to execute it, it is possible to prevent it. Sometimes the target state will know that a terrorist act is being planned, because of intelligence and infiltration of the terrorist organization. It is then it's duty to prevent it. Preemptive strikes are morally justifiable and are often used in conventional warfare. We believe that they should also be a legitimate method in the war between states and non-state actors. The preemptive strike however has to be conducted expediently. Extra-territorial rendition is the most expedient method of capturing key actors of the terrorist organization in order to prevent the act. Waiting for other states who might not be incentivized or might not have the means to capture the terrorists is a time-consuming process. Invading a country that harbors terrorists is also time-consuming and can be ineffective to the prevention of a terrorist act, because such an operation is long-term, it is focused on the long-term objective of destroying the terrorist organization and not on the short-term need of disarming key-players. When conducted properly extra-territorial rendition can capture key-players expediently, because it can be conducted by surprise. It is thus effective as a preemptive mechanism and is sometimes a necessary tool, because it is the most expedient. In the age of nuclear proliferation when non-state actors can acquire nuclear weapons, expediency is especially important and everything possible must be done to prevent a nuclear attack by a terrorist organization."}
{"id": 4088, "content": "\"'something should not be performed on specific grounds' IS grounds for that something to be outlawed\" The proposition is saying that extraterritorial rendition should be declared a war crime when it leads to torture. Does the proposition agree that in cases where it does not lead to torture it should not be declared a war crime? The proposition has not proven that extraterritorial rendition always inevitably leads to torture. They are making a convincing case against torture, but this is not what this debate should be about. So our claim stands: if extraterritorial rendition can be done without leading to torture, then it is not a war crime. The article we cite and the proposition also quote implies in its conclusion that extraterritorial abductions are necessary and inevitable. It specifically says that there needs to be a legal framework that determines when and how these abductions can be done. The proposition implies that this article does not agree with our position, but they have not shown how that is, where we have shown how it supports our case. Here, as in many of their own arguments, the proposition also claims that extraterritorial rendition is already considered a war crime. If that were the case there would be no need to have a debate over whether extraterritorial rendition should be declared a war crime or not. The proposition is either misunderstanding or misrepresenting their sources."}

Yet, and I quote again: \"Rohan Gunaratna, a Sri Lankan expert on terrorist interrogations who has consulted with several intelligence agencies, argued that rough tactics “can save hundreds of lives.”\" SO, every individual rendered has the potential to save the lives of hundreds or even thousands of civilians, since terrorist plots aim to invoke as much harm as they possibly can.

{"id": 4090, "content": "The good thing about immunization, is that if a majority of the people get the vaccination, the disease can almost completely be eliminated from society. If the population is immunized under that amount, it is still possible for diseases to have significant outbreaks. This concept is often referred to as herd immunization. Herd immunization is important because it minimizes the chances of those not vaccinated or those not able to vaccinated chances of getting serious diseases. If one person’s choice is not to get immunized they are directly harming another’s freedom from the disease. They are putting another at risk because of their own selfishness. People in society ought be required to get immunizations because is protects the rights of others. When we put the choice of being immunized into someone’s hands. I believe we are given freedom in our country, but freedom with consequence. We protest against ideas we believe are wrong, demonstrating our right of freedom of speech, and get arrested, we practice our right of freedom in not getting vaccinations, and we see the consequences by directly putting others in danger. So when we exercise our right of freedom in not being forced to get an immunization, we are really taking away someone elses freedom. Therefore you really can't argue that compulsory immunizations take away your freedom, if in not getting them your taking away other's freedoms. Everything you have come back to say is idiotic and makes no real connection to what the Aff is saying. The Neg obviously does not understand what the Aff is saying. They should make a vaccine for that."}

John Stuart Mill “the majority… the people, consequently, may desire to oppress a part of their number; and precautions are as much needed against this, as against any other abuse of power… In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign. John Stuart Mill “the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection.” Therefore the question is ‘what is the purpose of the vaccination?’ if it is to provide individuals with their own protection then autonomy of decision-making and individual liberty should predominate as guiding principles. Under these circumstances there can be little justification of any coercion on the part of public health officials, in particular the use of mandatory vaccination legislation. If it is more based upon public harm i.e. the more chance of the virus infecting from one human to another then the less this defence can be used."}

{"id": 4095, "content": "A significant distinction between the three available stances on the flow of medical personnel is one of perception. Both the ‘informal’ (status quo) and our ‘formalised’ model are able to consider trained medics as a resource that a country has the option to export, and to maximise. We have said that the current system contains a reprehensible inconsistency: medical personnel are treated as resources, but at the same time are not fully paid for in a way that makes the exchange comparable to a mutually beneficial exploitation of comparative advantage. Our proposed model has the benefit of QUALIFYING the classification of medical personnel as resources, by the fact that they are fully paid for. Then, the migration of medics to richer countries becomes an argument we can make in fully economic terms. To train a medic in the ‘poorer’ countries costs empirically less. Hence they have what we would call a comparative advantage in the production of a precious resource: medical personnel. A ‘richer’ country who seeks the use of such a resource does so at the best price available for maximum efficiency. In every other case where it is advantageous to do so, such cheaper resources are imported from the country which is able to supply it. In this case an investment, training, is required to produce the resource, but this investment IS COMPENSATED FOR as included in the economic cost of the import. We would expect that the employment of our model would result, as it does in most other cases of comparative advantage, in an exploitation of this profitable exchange- in this case an increase in investment in training of medical personnel in those poorer countries. Of course an increase in the supply of trained medical personnel is of enormous benefit to the global community. The inevitable disparity in wages offered between countries would result in the similarly inevitable disparity in aptitude of trained medical personnel being expressed, as it is in all other labour markets, through wage differentials. There will be some medics trained in poorer countries for whom the salary offered in their home country will be appropriate and desired, as well as those exceptional medics, liable to appear in any country around the world, whose services are more desired and therefore capable of earning higher wages. For this they will migrate, and they have a right to, and the country they were trained in will benefit from having cultivated such a precious resource. Our model is the expression of the international market for resources acting freely. If the motion were ‘Rich countries should actively recruit artists from poorer countries’ or ‘construction workers’, such an exchange would be considered laudable both on an individual level, which will be looked at next, and as demonstration of the efficient relocation of specialist workers to the place where they can be best rewarded for their human capital, and have the potential to actualise their training in the way that they most want to. On proposition side, we question whether medical personnel are any different, except for the important fact that their training may be compensated for and profited from, in a way that the status quo, with all other forms of economic migrants, does not account for."}

The people lost their rights to have their freedom, to decide what is best for them. The strong national defence in Burma maybe a signal of development in Burma, but does it comes from the citizens?

The democratization happen as a result of better condition of economic. To proceed, the country needs a more reliable system that can maintain the growth, put the government into an accountable position (where check and balances can be performed), and prevent the government from abusing its power. Only then, when the momentum is strong enough for change, after the people has witnessed the flaw of dictatorship that it's people will revert to a more sustainable mechanism; Democracy. But it doesn't mean that dictatorship is a prerequisite to democracy. The democratization allows a sustainable development to the middle class that is promisingly increase the income per capita. This is evident in South Korea in early 1990s. In the 1987 democratization movement, the new middle strata (Jungsangch'eung) that sided with the democracy movement against the authoritarian regime initially joined the popular sector. With industrialization, urban white collar workers which constituted the bulk of the new middle strata, rapidly increase in number."}

There is something wrong when the Federal Government is doing more for the low-income class than the religious groups who bark the loudest about the motivation for doing so. Making them like a normal business in tax world would make sure that they are paying their fair share and not having an unequal market advantage. It would force them to compete better.

Quotas are inherently helpful because they force businesses to adhere to the lofty goals they talk about in press releases. Simply put, a good quota is a promise that a company will actually care about diversity. How do we know that quotas are inherently helpful? It's easy - all we have to do is look at the sectors where quotas are already in place. Look at higher education, for example - not only are quotas in place, but they've been defended time and again as a necessity. Today's world sees more women and more people of color in universities than ever before, and that's something that's largely due to the quota system. Likewise, government positions are less overwhelmingly white and male than they have been in the past, and that's largely due to a government that embraces diversity and puts systems into place to make sure that the workplace remains diverse. It all comes down to money, though, and the Wall Street Journal writes that even large businesses agree that diversity targets are worth pursuing.

Simply put, quotas are already embraced as necessities in both the public and private sectors."}

As more women gain representation at the top of the ladder, more women will be seen as viable candidates for other roles. Remember, women aren't just underrepresented as C-level employees - they are underrepresented as leaders and managers throughout most organizations. Once you give a minority voice a place at the table, everyone under them is pulled up. This is a situation where a rising tide really does lift all boats. All one has to do is to look at businesses that have female CEOs to see the difference in workplace culture. It's hard to say that a woman doesn't have a place as a manage or a team leader, for example, if there is already a woman running the company. Mirroring is a basic part of instruction, so setting the tone for any place of work has to involve realistic demonstrations at the top. If there are no women leaders to look up to, there are going to be no examples for women to follow when they are working at lower levels of the company. Would a quota on boards help women in general? Not only would it put more women at higher positions, but it would help to get rid of any presumptions that a woman cannot lead. Setting quotas will directly lead to more diverse boards and better gender diversity."}
